Cetacians show features similar to that of fish: webbed head fins, a dorsal fin, patches of scales over their body, and/or a tail akin to that of a shark or dolphin.

# Trivia

- Cetacians exist in many colors and subspecies, and some are even mistaken for other races.
- Swimming is as common and essential of a skill for this race as learning to read and write. The unfortunate few who can't or don't want to are looked down upon in their society.
- All Cetacians have an extensive, vivid memory compared to other races. This can be a blessing for some and a curse for others.
