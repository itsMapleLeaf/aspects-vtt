## Gameplay

Like with other tabletop RPGs, the flow of the game will usually go like this:

- The GM will describe the situation, the characters involved, what they're doing, and what they're saying.
- Players respond by making actions or talking through their character.
- If a player action has a chance of failure, the GM should ask for a [dice roll](#dice) to determine how successful the action is.

And repeat!

## Dice

The game system makes use of a scale of dice:

d4 → d6 → d8 → d12 → d20

Any one of these dice will be rolled depending on the potential range of impact for what’s being rolled. For example: physically strong characters would use a d20 for strength-based actions, and smart characters would use a d20 for actions requiring high intellect.

In this system, even with stronger dice, any action can still be fumbled with a low roll! What this means is up to the situation and the GM’s jurisdiction.

If you roll the highest number on a die, that die **explodes**. Roll it again and add it to the total, repeating until the die no longer explodes.

The result of the roll is the **effect**. This may be used for mechanic purposes (e.g. determining success or failure) or for narrative flavor.

A **competing roll** is when two rolls are made to decide an outcome, usually between two different characters.

### Modifier Dice

Modifier dice are d4 dice rolled alongside the main die which add or remove from the effect of a dice roll.

There are two kinds of modifier dice: **boost** and **snag**. Boost dice add to the effect, and snag dice subtract from it.

Example: You make a d12 roll with 2 boost dice and 1 snag dice. The d12 yields 5. The boost dice yield 4 and 1. The snag dice yields 2. The effect is 8: 5 from the main d12 die, plus 4 and 1 from the boost dice, minus 2 from the snag.

Modifier dice are the _only_ way to strengthen or weaken a roll, and there’s no limit to the number of them a roll can have.

Modifier dice **do not explode**.
