# Date & Time

Keeping track of the current date and time gives the world a feeling of autonomy and life. You can make important events happen on certain dates, requiring players to be mindful of where they spend their time.

Each in-game day is divided into three parts: Daytime, Evening, and Nighttime. Each encounter or scene should occupy one of these times of day. For example: you could spend daytime going around town and collecting important information, spend the evening stocking up on supplies, then spend the night resting.

For some scenes, it may make sense to run multiple of them within one part of the day. The GM may make exceptions as they see fit.
