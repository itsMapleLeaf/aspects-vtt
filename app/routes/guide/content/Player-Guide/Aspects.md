# Aspects

Characters in this world each gain the ability to manipulate elements of nature, or **aspects**, to various ends. This act of manipulation is called **aspect art**.

Each aspect has its own strengths, weaknesses, and general vibes, but all of them can be used in many scenarios with several use cases.

Each aspect has a related [attribute](Attributes.md). When making an aspect art roll, use that aspect’s related attribute. For example, when doing [fire](Aspects/Aspects/Fire.md) aspect art, you’ll usually make a [strength](Attributes/Attributes/Strength.md) roll.

# Aspect Skills

Aspect skills are broad ways one can manipulate aspects. For example, fire skills include [heat manipulation](Aspects/Aspect-Skills-Table/Heat-Object.md), [fire generation](Aspects/Aspect-Skills-Table/Make-Flame.md), and [fire resistance](Aspects/Aspect-Skills-Table/Fire-Resistance.md). Water skills include [humidity manipulation](Aspects/Aspect-Skills-Table/Moisten.md), [heightened senses through air moisture](Aspects/Aspect-Skills-Table/Whispers-of-the-Mist.md), and [ice creation](Aspects/Aspect-Skills-Table/Flash-Freeze.md).

For each aspect, skills are organized in tiers of increasing power, complexity, and/or utility. A character’s proficiency in an aspect is represented by the number of skills they’ve learned in higher tiers.

Some skills or abilities may reference the **level** of an aspect. Your level in an aspect is the highest tier in which you have a skill.

## Learning Aspect Skills

Players can spend experience to learn new aspect skills. The cost of an aspect skill starts at 10, then goes up by 10 for each tier. Then the cost goes up by 5 for every other aspect you learn after the first.

To learn a new aspect skill, you **must** have a skill in the previous tier in that aspect. For example: you can’t learn a tier 3 fire skill unless you have at least a tier 1 and tier 2 skill.

|        | First Aspect | Second Aspect | Third Aspect | Fourth Aspect | Fifth Aspect |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Tier 1 | 10           | 15            | 20           | 25            | 30           |
| Tier 2 | 20           | 25            | 30           | 35            | 40           |
| Tier 3 | 30           | 35            | 40           | 45            | 50           |
| Tier 4 | 40           | 45            | 50           | 55            | 60           |
| Tier 5 | 50           | 55            | 60           | 65            | 70           |

## Using Aspect Skills

Skills can be used at different levels, and the level you use will determine its cost and effectiveness.

A character can only use a skill at a level that is **equal or lesser** than their level in that aspect. If an aspect is level 3, you can only use those aspect skills at levels 1 to 3, not 4 or 5.

On the tables below, match the skill with whichever relevant metrics apply, then use whichever fatigue cost is highest, first by dice value, then by dice count.

| Level         | 1    | 2    | 3     | 4     | 5     |
| ------------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Fatigue Cost  | 1d6  | 2d6  | 3d6   | 4d6   | 5d6   |
| Distance      | ≤ 2m | ≤ 5m | ≤ 10m | ≤ 15m | ≤ 30m |
| Area Diameter | ≤ 3m | ≤ 5m | ≤ 8m  | ≤ 12m | ≤ 20m |
| Target Count  | ≤ 3  | ≤ 5  | ≤ 8   | ≤ 12  | ≤ 20  |
| Boost Dice    | 0    | +1   | +2    | +3    | +4    |

| Fatigue Cost | 1d6                            | 2d6                                  | 3d6                               | 2d20                                | 3d20       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Duration     | A few seconds / 1 combat round | 30 seconds / 5 combat rounds or less | An hour / until the end of combat | Until the next scene or time of day | A full day |

# Aspect Interaction

There are many potential ways for aspects to interact that aren’t predetermined. It would be silly to predict everything that could happen! Therefore, interactions between aspects should be handled on a “whatever makes sense” basis.

Examples:

- A fireball meeting a blast of water in the air should cancel out in a puff of steam.
- Big and strong enough gusts of wind would put out impacted fires.
- Form of Shadow wouldn’t allow you to pass through solid light from Barrier, as darkness cannot pass through it.
