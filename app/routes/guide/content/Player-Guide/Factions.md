# Factions

With the outlands shaping much of today's society, deciding where people can be and where they can go, various schools of thought came about. People discussed—at length, sometimes violently—the relationship that Eisenkind should have with the outlands. The various threads of opinions eventually settled into larger, more generalized factions.

Factions are no more than core sets of ideals. Just like a political party or a religion, affiliating oneself with a faction only means saying you're a part of it. That being said, some factions build institutions and coalitions to further their beliefs.

## 🛡️ Protectionism

> _I don't know what's out there, and I don't care. I just want to live in peace._

As the faction with the most members, Protectionists view the outlands as a dangerous frontier which should not be crossed, and that Eisenkind should separate and protect themselves from it as much as much as possible.

Protectionists run most of Eisenwald's modern society, in Rosenfeld especially. Many members of this view the other factions as fringe, unrealistic, and even harmful.

## 👑 Imperialism

> _You're not scared of a bunch of dumb animals, are you? Can't take much to tame them._

Imperialists see the outlands as a resource for taking. They view outlandian life as inferior to Eisenkind, and their ideal future is one where outlandian creatures take on all of society's statedly meaningless labor, letting Eisenkind live in peace, comfort, and wealth.

Imperialists push for cities to bolster their military and resources to conquer the outlands. As you can imagine, many of them come from a position of wealth or power, absolving themselves from the front lines.

The only thing keeping protector’s guilds from turning into military bunkers is a strong democratic lean towards protectionist policies. However, that doesn't keep them from acting on their beliefs through questionably legal means.

## 🚫 Singularity

> _It's only a matter of time before those monsters devour everything we hold dear._

Singularity is the belief that the outlands and outlandian life do not belong in Eisenwald at all. They believe that resources spent building walls, constructing safety infrastructure, and hiring protectors should be spent destroying the outlands and eradicating all that lives within. For some, even if Eisenkind lives are lost in the process.

Most Singularists are actually more fearful of the outlands than those in other factions. They believe their mere _existence_ is too much of a threat to eisenkind life.

Some Singularists act with a stable, respectable, and realistic set of morals. But the active minority are caught starting forest fires, poisoning lakes, or even making use of chemical weapons. While succeeding in destroying the outlands, they knowingly disregard Eisenkind life caught in the crossfire.

Given eisenkind's knowledge of the outlands and its treacherousness, many actually don't strongly disagree with the ideals of Singularism. However, the aforementioned incidents have irreparably damaged that perception, causing many Singularists to hide their affiliation.

## ☮️ Cohabitation

> _They deserve to be here as much as we do. Maybe if we stopped shooting them on sight, we'd come to an understanding._

The Cohabitation faction believes that outland life is sacred and just as valuable as that of Eisenkind. Some even believe in a world where civilization can cross with the outlands, where all inhabitants of Eisenwald can live in peace and harmony.

Many Cohabitationists further much of eisenkind’s knowledge about the outlands, feeling more compelled to research and experiment than others who view the outlands through a more negative or fearful lens. Many are knowledgeable, talented explorers and biologists who believe Protectionists are holding society back.

However, there are the few who act less wisely. Those who open paths for dangerous outland creatures to encroach society, many occurrences of which did not end well. The emotional impact of these cases damaged the public perception of Cohabitation as a whole.

## 🪷 Naturalism

> _How would you feel if some self-righteous arrogant bandits took away your home and forced you to leave? Eisenkind are no better._

Naturalists believe that the land rightfully belongs to the outlandian creatures, and that Eisenkind have wrongfully stolen it from them and upset the balance of nature.

Their actions include destroying the infrastructure that protects Eisenkind from the outlands, seeking and stopping protectors, and inciting the wrath of outlandians through various means. Naturalists have long debated and fought over whether these methods are productive.

Members of this faction tend to act out of the eyes of society and, more importantly, the law. They're often found in the Undergrowth and the various unwatched spaces betwixt societies, but some are perfectly comfortable walking among crowds and hiding in plain sight.
