# Actions

For any action your character makes with varying levels of success, you’ll roll with whichever attribute fits the most.

As a baseline, actions which require some level of effort will cost 1d4 fatigue. This may increase depending on the scenario: breaking glass will take less effort than breaking solid concrete.

However, some actions in the game can be made without a roll, e.g. if they’re mechanically unimpactful, or if there’s no failure or success case. For example:

- Waving to someone
- Tapping someone’s shoulder to get their attention
- Warning others of incoming danger
- Giving a friend a hug

<aside>
ℹ️ Depending on the circumstances, the GM may ask for a roll with some of these examples anyways. Like if a person is distracted, or if your presence is subdued, you may need to make competing rolls to see if they notice you, or if they get startled.
