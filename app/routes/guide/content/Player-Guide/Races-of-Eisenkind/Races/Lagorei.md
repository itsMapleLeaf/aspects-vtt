# Trivia

- Touching a lagorei’s ears is considered a great offense to many of them.
- Many Lagorei possess heightened leg strength, making them great runners and athletes in general.
- Lagorei evolved to deal with danger by running. This gives them a more sensitive startle response, sometimes causing them to accidentally kick the one who startled them. Very hard.

Back then, most Lagorei preferred to move often between regions, never staying in one place for very long. Although that tradition stays with a large number of them, many have still opted to settle down around the turn of Eisenwald’s modernization. As a result, Lagorei are known for their depth of worldly knowledge and experience passed between generations of their species.
