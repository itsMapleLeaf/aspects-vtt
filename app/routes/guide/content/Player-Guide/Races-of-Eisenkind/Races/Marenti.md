# History

Marenti are historically known to run from their battles and solve their problems in non-forceful, roundabout ways. Because of that, they have a reputation for being cowardly and physically weaker than other races. This prejudice has led most of them into mentally-focused roles, such as librarians, teachers, historians, and accountants.

However, that hasn’t stopped those who are able and eager to fill physically demanding rolls. Some even use this misjudgment to their advantage, hiding their strength while it’s convenient.
