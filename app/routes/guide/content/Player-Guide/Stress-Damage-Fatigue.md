# Stress: Damage & Fatigue

**Stress** represents the wear and tear your character experiences over time.

The two types of stress are:

1. **Damage**, which represents physical injuries, like cuts, bruises, and broken bones.
2. **Fatigue**, which models non-physical mental stress, like exhaustion, headaches, confusion, or insanity.

Both types of stress are tracked separately, starting at 0 and going up.

# Thresholds

Your stress thresholds represent the limit of each type of stress your character can take.

Your damage threshold is the sum of your Strength and Mobility values.

Your fatigue threshold is the sum of your Sense, Intellect, and Wit values.

While you've exceeded your damage threshold, you become incapacitated. You can see, but you cannot move or make any actions.

While you've exceeded your fatigue threshold, you become unconscious. You cannot move, see, or take any actions.

Healing either stress amount to or below your threshold removes the critical state.
