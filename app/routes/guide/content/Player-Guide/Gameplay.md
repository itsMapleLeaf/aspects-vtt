# Gameplay

The flow of the game will usually go something like this:

1. The GM sets the scene, describing where the players are and what’s around them, perhaps pointing out things of note.
2. Players will make [actions](Actions.md), such as approaching something for a closer look, picking up something for closer inspection, or walking up to another character to talk to them.
3. The GM tells the players what happens next, what they find, or what they learn. Depending on the action, the GM may prompt for a [dice roll](Dice.md).
   1. For player actions that may or may not succeed, that player will roll with the appropriate [attribute](Attributes.md). If a player wants to try to break open a door, they’d make a [Strength](Attributes/Attributes/Strength.md) roll. If they want to sense danger, they’d make a [Sense](Attributes/Attributes/Sense.md) roll.
   2. For unanswered questions and scenarios that are up to chance, the GM could make a [fortune roll](Fortune-Rolls.md) to decide the likelihood of a certain outcome, such as whether or not a specific item can be found nearby.
4. Frequent, strenuous, or unsuccessful actions may result in players taking [stress](Stress-Damage-Fatigue.md).
5. If tensions rise, you may enter [combat](Combat.md). All involved characters act in turn until all adversarial acts end.
   1. In combat, characters go back and forth making actions, usually using their [aspect skills](Aspects.md) to best their enemies or aid their allies.
6. While in the scene, go to #2.
7. When moving to a new scene, restart at #1.

This game system was designed with a focus on **narrative** (1) and **flexibility** (2):

1. More fun is had when a good story is had. To the best of their ability, **players should act in narratively interesting ways**, sticking to their character’s personality and doing what they would do, even if it’s not the most advantageous move from a gameplay standpoint.
2. **Players should feel free to act however they like**, within reason, within the rules of the game, and within the rules of the world they’re in, even if their action isn’t [codified in the game system](General-Skills.md).
   1. Unwritten actions may be translated anyways. Poking someone in the eye might be considered a [Strike](General-Skills/General-Skills/Strike.md) action, but using [Mobility](Attributes/Attributes/Mobility.md) for precision instead of [Strength](Attributes/Attributes/Strength.md).
