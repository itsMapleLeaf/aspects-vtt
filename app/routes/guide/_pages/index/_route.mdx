# Player Guide

Welcome to **Aspects of Nature**. Choose from many [augmented human races](races-of-eisenkind) and harness the [power of nature](aspects) to further your destiny.

Maybe you’ll choose to defend against the dangers of [the outlands](the-outlands). Maybe you believe outland creatures and Eisenkind can live in harmony. Or maybe you want to give [Eisenwald](eisenwald) back to the outland creatures, its rightful owner.

Regardless of the [path](factions) you take, stay aware and vigilant. In this landscape of persistent conflict and divisiveness, even your most trusted allies could be plotting against you.
