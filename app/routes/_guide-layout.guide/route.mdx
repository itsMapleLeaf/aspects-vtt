Welcome to **Aspects of Nature**. Choose from many [augmented human races](#races-of-eisenkind) and harness the [power of nature](#aspects) to further your destiny.

Maybe you’ll choose to defend against the dangers of [the outlands](#the-outlands). Maybe you believe outland creatures and Eisenkind can live in harmony. Or maybe you want to give [Eisenwald](#eisenwald) back to the outland creatures, its rightful owner.

Regardless of the [path](#factions) you take, stay aware and vigilant. In this landscape of persistent conflict and divisiveness, even your most trusted allies could be plotting against you.

# Gameplay

The flow of the game will usually go something like this:

1. The GM sets the scene, describing where the players are and what’s around them, perhaps pointing out things of note.

2. Players will make [actions](#actions), such as approaching something for a closer look, picking up something for closer inspection, or walking up to another character to talk to them.

3. The GM tells the players what happens next, what they find, or what they learn. Depending on the action, the GM may prompt for a [dice roll](#modifier-dice).

   1. For player actions that may or may not succeed, that player will roll with the appropriate [attribute](#attributes). If a player wants to try to break open a door, they’d make a [Strength](#strength) roll. If they want to sense danger, they’d make a [Sense](#sense) roll.
   2. For unanswered questions and scenarios that are up to chance, the GM could make a [fortune roll](#fortune-rolls) to decide the likelihood of a certain outcome, such as whether or not a specific item can be found nearby.

4. Frequent, strenuous, or unsuccessful actions may result in players taking [physical](#health) or [mental](#resolve) damage.

5. If tensions rise, you may enter [combat](#combat). All involved characters act in turn until all adversarial acts end.

   1. In combat, characters go back and forth making actions, usually using their [aspect skills](#aspects) to best their enemies or aid their allies.

6. While in the scene, go to #2.

7. When moving to a new scene, restart at #1.

This game system was designed with a focus on **narrative** (1) and **flexibility** (2):

1. More fun is had when a good story is had. To the best of their ability, **players should act in narratively interesting ways**, sticking to their character’s personality and doing what they would do, even if it’s not the most advantageous move from a gameplay standpoint.

2. **Players should feel free to act however they like**, within reason, within the rules of the game, and within the rules of the world they’re in, even if their action isn’t [codified in the game system](#actions).

# Character Creation

There’s no fancy character sheet to print and fill out (yet?), so open up your favorite text editor, or get some pencil and paper.

## Template

### Race

Defines your characters visual features and core abilities. See [Races of Eisenkind](#races-of-eisenkind)

### Homeland

Your character’s birthplace, which can influence their upbringing in a few ways. See [Locations](#locations)

### Alignment

A character’s alignment is a basic guideline that informs how they interact with the world and others around them.

|         | Evil         | Neutral         | Good         |
| ------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------ |
| Lawful  | Lawful Evil  | Lawful Neutral  | Lawful Good  |
| Neutral | Neutral Evil | Pure Neutral    | Neutral Good |
| Chaotic | Chaotic Evil | Chaotic Neutral | Chaotic Good |

#### Morality

Good - acting to the benefit of others

Neutral - acting solely with yourself in mind

Evil - acting selfishly without regard of the well being of others, often to the detriment of them

#### Order

Lawful - acting on a strict set of codes, whether that’s religious guidelines, laws, or ideals passed down through family

Neutral - making the most reasonable judgement given the situation

### Trades

What does your character like to profess in? This doesn’t have to be a paying job, just something they’re interested and skilled at. You can have multiple!

### Strength, Mobility, Sense, Intellect, Wit

You have 15 points to allocate to your attributes. Each one must be from 1 to 5. See [Attributes](#attributes) for more details.

### Bio

Any other details you want to provide about your character. Their personality, upbringing, likes, dislikes, hobbies, and so on. Can be as short or as long as you like.

<aside data-type="tip">
You don’t have to include every detail on your character sheet! It’s fun to keep some things a secret to dramatically reveal later. 🤭

</aside>

## Tracked Values

The remaining values can be tracked via [AspectsVTT](https://aspects.mapleleaf.dev). But if you want to track them manually, add them to your character sheet:

### Health

See [Health](#health)

### Resolve

See [Resolve](#resolve)

### Notes

Notes are this world’s currency. This is the number of notes your character has. This can start at any number, but 100 is a good number. See [Currency](#currency)

### Items

The list of items owned by your character. See [Items](#items)

### Trades

The trades your character has learned, and the level of each one. See [Trades (WIP)](#trades-wip)

## Example Character

- Name: River
- Gender: Female
- Pronouns: she/her

- Race: Pyra
- Homeland: The Whisperwood
- Alignment: Neutral Good
- Trades: Archery, Hunting, Fishing, Woodworking

- Strength: 2
- Mobility: 5
- Sense: 4
- Intellect: 2
- Wit: 2

Of her early childhood, River can’t remember anything but waking up alone in the woods as the sun was going down. She wandered, hiding and running away from all sorts of creatures, some more dangerous than others.

Later on, she encounters a small clan of Renari in the forest. Seeing value in her, they take her in and train her to keep outsiders out of the forest. This is more or less the only experience she’s known since that point: waking up early, going through rough, rigorous combat training, eating somewhere in the middle of that, then going to sleep.

River becomes a proper defender for the clan as she grows into adulthood. At first, she relentlessly and mercilessly attacks anyone who happens to cross her clan’s territory. However, a few choice encounters and a handful of friends made have shifted her perspective towards outsiders. She keeps these relationships a secret from the clan.

With all of the stories her friends have told her, River hopes to leave one day and see what the world outside the forest has in store for her.

# Attributes

Your character might be better at tasks that require lots of physical strength or agility, or maybe they’re a bookworm, known for having rich knowledge and clear memory. Maybe they’re very calm and tranquil, with high awareness of their surroundings, or maybe they’re a social butterfly, who can make friends with anyone they meet.

Your character’s strengths and weaknesses are described through a handful of attributes:

- <strong id="strength">Strength</strong>: Your character’s physical power, which can be used to
  move, lift, or otherwise exert force.

- <strong id="sense">Sense</strong>: Your character’s awareness of their surroundings, which can be
  used to sense danger, locate hidden things, or detect things that are hidden.

- <strong id="mobility">Mobility</strong>: Your character’s ability to move around, which can be
  used to move through the environment, avoid danger, or move to a new location.

- <strong id="intellect">Intellect</strong>: Your character’s intelligence, which can be used to
  understand things, make decisions, or solve problems.

- <strong id="wit">Wit</strong>: Your character’s social aptitude, which can be used to understand
  social cues, introspect one's feelings, or sway them in various ways.

At character creation, you have **15 points** to allocate to attributes. Each attribute must have 1 to 5 points.

<aside data-type="info">
	This restriction does **not** apply to NPCs, who can have as low or as high of levels as the GM
	likes.
</aside>

The number of points an attribute has is its **level**. When rolling with an attribute, a die will be used depending on the level:

| Level | Die |
| ----- | --- |
| 1     | d4  |
| 2     | d6  |
| 3     | d8  |
| 4     | d10 |
| 5     | d12 |

The face count on the attribute’s die is the **power** of the attribute.

Example: If your Strength has 3 points, your Strength’s level is **3**, and your Strength’s power is **8**.

<aside data-type="info">
	Some parts of the guide may refer to the power as the **value**. This is the old term. Power and
	value mean the same thing.
</aside>

By default, **attribute rolls are always made with two dice**, and the result is the total of the two.

## Stat examples

A balanced wit-focused character:

| Attribute | Level | Die | Power |
| --------- | ----- | --- | ----- |
| Strength  | 3     | d8  | 8     |
| Sense     | 3     | d8  | 8     |
| Mobility  | 3     | d8  | 8     |
| Intellect | 2     | d6  | 6     |
| Wit       | 4     | d10 | 10    |

A mindless athletic brute:

| Attribute | Level | Die | Power |
| --------- | ----- | --- | ----- |
| Strength  | 5     | d12 | 12    |
| Sense     | 2     | d6  | 6     |
| Mobility  | 5     | d12 | 12    |
| Intellect | 1     | d4  | 4     |
| Wit       | 2     | d6  | 6     |

A mild-mannered scholar:

| Attribute | Level | Die | Power |
| --------- | ----- | --- | ----- |
| Strength  | 1     | d4  | 4     |
| Sense     | 5     | d12 | 12    |
| Mobility  | 1     | d4  | 4     |
| Intellect | 5     | d12 | 12    |
| Wit       | 3     | d8  | 8     |

# Health

A character’s **health** represents the amount of <strong id="damage">damage</strong> they can take before going down. Your character’s max health equals the combined power of your [Strength](#strength) and [Mobility](#mobility).

For example: If you have a d10 for Strength and a d6 for Mobility, then your max health is 16.

When your health reaches zero, you become **incapacitated**. You cannot move or make actions until you are healed.

# Resolve

Resolve represents your character’s mental energy, awareness, or fortitude. Resolve is often spent to perform several mind-focused tasks, but it can also decrease from weathering mentally taxing situations.

Your max resolve equals the combined power of your Sense, Intellect, and Wit.

Example: If you have a d4 in Sense, a d12 in Intellect, and a d10 in Wit, your max resolve is 26.

When your resolve equals zero, you become **exhausted**. While exhausted, your action points are limited to **one** until your resolve is healed.

# Modifier Dice

Modifier dice are d6 dice added to rolls to modify the outcome. There are two kinds of modifier dice:

- <strong id="boost-dice">Boost</strong>: Adds to the result.

- <strong id="snag-dice">Snag</strong>: Subtracts from the result.

# Fortune Rolls

Fortune rolls are d100 dice, usually rolled by the GM to determine the outcome of something luck-based or otherwise out of your control, such as the chances of rain, or the chances of a specific item being nearby.

The required number is chosen based on the likelihood of the outcome being rolled for. For example: 50 would mean a 50% chance of the outcome, and 99 would mean a 1% chance of the outcome.

<aside data-type="info">
	If these percentages seem off by one, remember that the d100 dice starts at 0 and ends at 99!
</aside>

# Actions

Actions are acts made by your character, which can be anything from moving, to attacking, to using a tool, or even just resting.

Most actions are free, but depending on the impact or complexity of the task, the GM may require you to spend [resolve](#resolve) to perform the action.

## Pushing Yourself

Any time you roll for an action, you can spend **2 resolve** to **push yourself**. This adds one [boost die](#modifier-dice) to the roll. You can do this any number of times per action.

## Assist

When an ally rolls for an action, you may use **1 resolve** to **assist** them. This adds a boost die to their roll. You can only do this once per action, and you must narratively describe how you're helping them.

## Attacks

An attack is an action made to deal damage to other characters.

To make an attack:

1. **Choose a target to attack.** In some circumstances, you might be able to choose multiple targets.
2. **[Roll the fitting attribute](#attributes)** to determine the damage amount. For [Strike](#strike) this would be [Strength](#strength), and for [Shoot](#shoot) this would be [Sense](#sense).
3. **The target(s) respond** in one of a few ways:
   1. **<strong id="evade">Evade</strong>.** If the target’s [Mobility](#mobility) is higher than the damage amount, they avoid all damage.
   2. **<strong id="defend">Defend</strong>.** They reduce the damage by the power of their [Strength](#strength), to no less than 1.

### Examples

- You attack and roll 13.
  The opponent's strength and mobility dice are a d4 and d8.
  The damage is too high for them to try to evade it (13 > 8) so they’ll defend instead, and take 9 damage (13 - 4).
- An opponent attacks you and rolls 7.
  Your strength and mobility dice are a d8 and a d10.
  Since the power of your mobility die is higher than the amount (10 > 7), you can evade and avoid all damage.
- An opponent attacks you and rolls 11.
  Your strength and mobility dice are a d12 and a d6.
  The damage is higher than your mobility (11 > 6) so you defend, reducing the damage to 1
  (11 - 12, minimum 1 → 1).

# Aspects

Characters in this world each gain the ability to manipulate elements of nature, or **aspects**. This act of manipulation is called **aspect art**.
Each aspect has its own strengths, weaknesses, and general vibes, but all of them can be used in many scenarios with several use cases.

Each aspect has a related [attribute](#attributes). When making an aspect art roll, use that aspect’s related attribute. For example, when doing [fire](#fire) aspect art, you’ll usually make a [strength](#strength) roll.

## Fire

Fire is the aspect of blind fury and relentless destruction. The end of dealing huge bursts of damage comes with the cost of taking chunks of that damage yourself.

Some are more careful with the way they use it, others less so, glad to take the not-so-small tax of a dozen burns to reduce the opposition to a crisp.

## Water

Water, ice, and mist all have great utility in everyday life, as well as more active scenarios like combat.

Water is best used defensively: creating barriers, obstacles, and smoke screens to make things harder for their enemies, or building bridges for their allies.

However, as evidenced by floods, tsunamis, typhoons, and other natural disasters, the indiscriminate nature of water requires great thought and care into where and how it's used.

<Column>
## Wind

Although wind is known for being a whimsical, unreliable aspect, none deny its utility.

Those daring enough to try to work with this aspect make themselves useful in situations requiring swiftness, snappy reactions, and acrobatic mastery to run, climb, or leap past daunting obstacles.

Provided the wind plays nice with them.

## Light

The healing and recovery of light is an essential staple of any society. Eisenkind collectively have great respect and thankfulness towards those who work diligently to ensure the well-being of their comrades.

Most of all, light users are seen as brave and selfless, as the strength of their light increases the more they exhaust themselves, almost always risking their own health to keep others standing.

</Column>

<Column>
## Darkness

As darkness exists in the absence of light, the strength of darkness comes with the perceived absence of its users.

Darkness inflicts dread, confusion, and weakness in the form of illusions, curses, and manipulation to varying degrees.

Although some are strong-willed enough to see through a darkness user's tricks, they still make very fearsome foes in social situations.

</Column>
</Row>

## Aspect Skills

Aspect skills are broad ways one can manipulate aspects. For example, fire skills include [heat manipulation](#heat-object), [fire generation](#make-flame), and [fire resistance](#fire-resistance). Water skills include [humidity manipulation](#moisten), [heightened senses through air moisture](#whispers-of-the-mist), and [ice creation](#flash-freeze).

For each aspect, skills are organized in tiers of increasing power, complexity, and/or utility. A character’s proficiency in an aspect is represented by the number of skills they’ve learned in higher tiers.

Some skills or abilities may reference the **level** of an aspect, which is the highest tier you have a skill in.

### Learning Aspect Skills

Players can spend experience to learn new aspect skills. The cost of an aspect skill starts at 10, then goes up by 10 for each tier. Then the cost goes up by 5 for every other aspect you learn after the first.

To learn a new aspect skill, you **must** have a skill in the previous tier in that aspect. For example: you can’t learn a tier 3 fire skill unless you have at least a tier 1 and tier 2 skill.

|        | First Aspect | Second Aspect | Third Aspect | Fourth Aspect | Fifth Aspect |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Tier 1 | 10           | 15            | 20           | 25            | 30           |
| Tier 2 | 20           | 25            | 30           | 35            | 40           |
| Tier 3 | 30           | 35            | 40           | 45            | 50           |
| Tier 4 | 40           | 45            | 50           | 55            | 60           |
| Tier 5 | 50           | 55            | 60           | 65            | 70           |

### Using Aspect Skills

To use an aspect skill, pick one of your learned aspect skills, describe how you're making use of it, then roll the aspect’s related attribute.

The GM determines the required success level for the action, if an y. Higher for more difficult actions, lower for easier ones.

You may use any aspect skill as an [attack](#actions), as long as you can describe how it's being used as such. For attacks, the roll result is the damage amount.

By default, your aspect art can only affect nearby targets and areas, but you can spend resolve to make it more powerful. You can buy any modifier any number of times.

| Modifier | Description                                                    | Cost                                   |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Area     | Adds an [area of effect](#positioning--distance) to your skill | 2 resolve, +3m area size               |
| Path     | Add a path of effect (only cardinal directions, not diagonal)  | 1 resolve, +5m path length             |
| Target   | Target one extra character or object                           | 2 resolve, +1 target                   |
| Range    | Increase how far away your target or aspect art can be         | 1 resolve, +5m away                    |
| Duration | Lengthen the duration of the skill                             | 1 resolve, +1 minute or +1 combat turn |

## Aspect Interaction

There are many potential ways for aspects to interact that aren’t predetermined. It would be silly to predict everything that could happen! Therefore, interactions between aspects should be handled on a “whatever makes sense” basis.

Examples:

- A fireball meeting a blast of water in the air should cancel out in a puff of steam.
- Big and strong enough gusts of wind would put out impacted fires.
- Form of Shadow wouldn’t allow you to pass through solid light from Barrier, as darkness cannot pass through it.

# Positioning & Distance

Characters are positioned on a 2D grid, where each grid space, or **area**, represents a square meter.

You are considered **nearby** to another character if you occupy the same area or the area adjacent to them.

You must be nearby a target to physically interact with it, e.g. using Strike or other touch-based actions.

Distances are only considered in cardinal directions, never diagonally. For example, if you move two meters forward and two meters left, your distance from the starting point is 4 meters. This is also called the [Manhattan distance](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance).

Effects describing “areas of a size” define a square with that width and height.

# Combat

Characters enter combat when two or more parties act adversarially towards one another. Combat ends when all adversarial acts end.

## Turn Order

To determine the turn order during a round, roll [Mobility](#mobility), going from highest to lowest, breaking ties if necessary.

Different scenarios may call for a different attribute, such as [Intellect](#intellect) or [Wit](#wit) in more socially-focused situations.

The GM may also change the turn order depending on the circumstances. If a fight was started by two characters, it would make sense for those characters to go before others, regardless of rolls.

On your turn:

- You can make **one** [action](#actions)

- You can spend **2 resolve** for an extra action

Outside of your turn:

- You can make **one reaction** in response to the current character’s action.
  Once you use your reaction, you can’t make another reaction until after your next turn.

# Teams

In combat, every character can be a part of a team, or they can be unaffiliated. Characters within a team are all allies of one another. Other characters outside of their team are either considered neutral or enemies, depending on the scenario and other circumstances.

# Experience

Experience represents the breadth of the party’s experiences in the campaign. The experience amount is shared by all player characters, and [can be spent to learn aspect skills](#aspects).

By default, players should start with 100 experience to spend on aspect skills, but you may use a different number (or none at all) to change the difficulty of the campaign’s starting experience.

Throughout the campaign, experience should be awarded by the GM on a per-session basis. As a guideline, you can aim for 5 experience for every significant event or challenge overcome in the session.

# Items

**Items** are consumables, tools, or equipment which can be used in various ways, often to give yourself a buff, or to be used offensively in battle.

**There is no predetermined list of items!** This system is written so you can take any item you could come up with and add gameplay effects to it.

## Qualities

An item’s **qualities** determines what happens when you use the item.

Qualities on items also have a **level** which describes how powerful or impactful the quality is.

An item can have **any** number of qualities, and there is **no limit** to quality levels.

| Quality (pos / neg) | Variants          | Effect                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Boost / Snag        | per attribute     | +1 die per level                      |
| Restoring / Poison  | health or resolve | ±1d4 per level                        |
| Energize / Hinder   | n/a               | ±1 action point per level             |
| Mobilize / Ensnare  | n/a               | ±1 meter per level of combat movement |
| Strengthen / Weaken | health or resolve | ±1 max per level                      |

## Item Types

Items come in various types depending on how one should use them:

- Consumable - the item has one or more uses before it is extinguished
- Equipment - on use, the item is worn on the character, and effects apply passively
- Tool - the item's effect applies on use, and has any number of usages

## Example Items

Let’s say your character is an archer. They come with a leather vest, a pair of cargo shorts, boots, a longbow with arrows, and a dagger. Let’s apply item properties:

- Leather Vest - Equipment, Strengthen 5 (Health)

  - A leather vest should give them some protection. The Strengthen quality fits here, giving them +5 max health.

- Cargo Shorts - Equipment, Energize 1

  - The cargo shorts might come with some extra pockets to store stuff in, therefore providing utility in combat and other scenarios. We’ll pick Energize for an extra action point.

- Boots - Equipment, Mobilize 3

  - The boots help them navigate tough terrain more quickly and confidently. This will give them 3 extra meters of movement.

- Longbow - Tool, Boost 1 (Sense)

  - The quintessential longbow helps deliver more impactful hits on enemies. We’ll boost sense to make [Shoot](#shoot) actions more powerful.

- Arrows - Consumable, Boost 1 (Sense)

  - Arrows add onto the bonus from longbows, so we’ll give it the same quality.

- Dagger - Tool, Boost 3 (Strength)
  - We can boost strength to make [Strike](#strike) or [Throw](#throw) actions with this dagger more effective.

# Trades (WIP)

<aside data-type="warning">The trades system is a work in progress.</aside>

**Trades** are specific practical skills that can help with relevant tasks.

## Levels

As characters practice their trade, they become more skilled in it, and their level in that trade will increase. Each level adds a boost die for rolls using the trade.

# Date & Time

Keeping track of the current date and time gives the world a feeling of autonomy and life. You can make important events happen on certain dates, requiring players to be mindful of where they spend their time.

Each in-game day is divided into three parts: Daytime, Evening, and Nighttime. Each encounter or scene should occupy one of these times of day. For example: you could spend daytime going around town and collecting important information, spend the evening stocking up on supplies, then spend the night resting.

For some scenes, it may make sense to run multiple of them within one part of the day. The GM may make exceptions as they see fit.

# Travel (WIP)

Start of day, either…

- Uneventful, and the party can either…
  - Venture forth
    - Take 2d6 fatigue
  - Rest
    - Heal 3d6 fatigue
- Some kinda encounter

# Eisenwald

> _Once upon a time, there were two umbraleth sisters: Aurora and Nocturne. At their awakening, the only company they had were each other. Faced with the darkness and danger of the surrounding uninhabited wilderness, they needed to quell their fears and work to survive the unflinching dangers of the Outlands._
>
> _One day, the two felt a spark, a vague feeling that would allow them to follow the path to entangle themselves with the very nature of reality itself._
>
> _It started with manipulating water, making use of it in various ways, from offense, to protection, to healing and comfort. More experimentation led to more advanced techniques, such as turning water to ice and frost and embedding one's senses into the surrounding moisture in the air._
>
> _The two girls experimented further, moving from aspect to aspect, eventually landing on the five that Eisenkind are familiar with today: Fire, Water, Wind, Light, and Darkness._
>
> _Aurora and Nocturne made use of their new skills to fend off the dangers of the Outlands. They travelled across Eisenwald, meeting other people and saving as many as they could, while passing their knowledge to them as well._
>
> _A civilization naturally came out of this gathering of Eisenkind, growing more and more, gradually becoming safer and more prosperous as Eisenkind gained more aptitude in technology and aspect art._
>
> _Roses were Aurora’s favorite flower. Out of love, Nocturne wanted to give their safe haven a name: Rosenfeld._
>
> _After the passing of the two sisters, Eisenkind collectively named the two formerly unnamed moons after them. The older sister, Nocturne, became the larger moon, and the younger sister, Aurora, became the smaller moon._
>
> _But maybe that’s just a fairy tale._

Aspects of Nature takes place in **Eisenwald**, a world populated by numerous varieties of human-like people called **Eisenkind**, each possessing features of one of many animals.

The world's landscape is split into diverse, distinct regions, each spotted with cities and towns formed as safe havens from the surrounding outlands.

![A first-person view of Rosenfeld, Eisenwald's largest city.](/guide/rosenfeld.png)

In terms of architecture, culture, food, and so on, cities in Eisenwald feel like a mix of familiar fantasy tropes and elements of modern society.

You’ll enter a walkable city with stone buildings and cobblestone streets filled with people dressed in colorful, stylish, and sometimes showy outfits. Spacious residential housings intermix with restaurants, clothing stores, marketplaces, and other businesses, many of which are self-run and unique to the town you’re in.

# Races of Eisenkind

![A group of Eisenkind friends having a chat over coffee.](/guide/coffee-chat.png)

Eisenwald is populated by human-like people, or **eisenkind**, with features of animals, such as dogs, cats, foxes, and birds, as well as other fantasy races like dragons and demons. Eisenkind exist in harmony alongside their races’ origin animals, as well as a breadth of other fanatical creatures and mixes thereof.

## Names

Eisenkind receive only a given name at birth, without any family name or last name, simply because the societal need for that hasn’t risen. The origins of these names can be categorized into a few main groups:

1. **Fantasy**: These names have an otherworldly sound and feel to them, inspired by fantasy and mythology.
   - Masculine examples: Castiel, Astraeus, Asmodai, Rurik, Fenrir, Lucian
   - Feminine examples: Euthalia, Lirael, Lysandra, Sylvia, Elysia, Lilith
   - Unisex examples: Aeris, Rowan, Lyric, Talon, Phoenix, Kael
2. **Nature**: These names have roots in the natural world, encompassing flora, fauna, seasons, celestial bodies, and other natural phenomena.
   - Masculine examples: Orion, August, Ash, Clay, Hawthorn, Forrest
   - Feminine examples: Lily, Summer, Luna, Amber, Aurora, Celeste
   - Unisex examples: River, Winter, Jupiter, Hazel, Robin, Storm
3. **Everyday**: These names are drawn from ordinary everyday objects or concepts that hold a special significance to the individual. This can be a favorite instrument, color, garment, a cherished item, or a comforting idea.
   - Masculine examples: Jet, Oak, Jasper, Reed, Piano, Chip
   - Feminine examples: Scarlet, Viola, Garnet, Pearl, Velvet, Crystal
   - Unisex examples: Quill, Sage, Indigo, Echo, Scout, Rogue

## Custom Races

With eisenkind being as diverse as they are, some existing races may not fit into one of the predetermined categories.

When creating a character, you’re free to invent your own race and its abilities, as long as it fits the human-like theme of the others and you have approval from the GM.

You may also pick a more specific race, but choose the abilities from the closest one available. For example: felirians are based off of house cats by default, but a felirian character could be based on a lion, tiger, cheetah, jaguar, or any other feline animal. Likewise, a lizard-like character would probably fall under [Pyra](#pyra).

# Locations

Eisenwald is partitioned into various distinct regions with their own look, feel, and sights to see, from lush forests with diverse selections of plant species, to vast, snowy taigas, to networks of caverns hosting their own unique variety of plant life, to cities built on the waters of a coastal gulf, and so on.

# The Outlands

![A Lagorei girl preparing herself to face The Outlands.](/guide/outlands.webp)

The Outlands refer to the uncharted areas outside civilization populated by a wide variety of wildlife, ranging from friendly and harmless, to ferocious and monstrous.

Many were once taught from a young age to stay within the safe confines of their home. However, the more adventurous and brave few opt to risk their well-being and venture through anyways. Some do it to protect the ones they love, some do it to profit from valuable resources that can be found within, some for deeply personal reasons, and others just to brag and say they made it through.

Nowadays, advancements in technology, weaponry, medicine, navigation, and aspect art have made it easier for anyone who wishes to delve into the depths. Despite all that, mistakes can be, and often are, fatal.

# Factions

With the outlands shaping much of today's society, deciding where people can be and where they can go, various schools of thought came about. People discussed—at length, sometimes violently—the relationship that Eisenkind should have with the outlands. The various threads of opinions eventually settled into larger, more generalized factions.

Factions are no more than core sets of ideals. Just like a political party or a religion, affiliating oneself with a faction only means saying you're a part of it. That being said, some factions build institutions and coalitions to further their beliefs.

## 🛡️ Protectionism

> _I don't know what's out there, and I don't care. I just want to live in peace._

As the faction with the most members, Protectionists view the outlands as a dangerous frontier which should not be crossed, and that Eisenkind should separate and protect themselves from it as much as much as possible.

Protectionists run most of Eisenwald's modern society, in Rosenfeld especially. Many members of this view the other factions as fringe, unrealistic, and even harmful.

## 👑 Imperialism

> _You're not scared of a bunch of dumb animals, are you? Can't take much to tame them._

Imperialists see the outlands as a resource for taking. They view outlandian life as inferior to Eisenkind, and their ideal future is one where outlandian creatures take on all of society's statedly meaningless labor, letting Eisenkind live in peace, comfort, and wealth.

Imperialists push for cities to bolster their military and resources to conquer the outlands. As you can imagine, many of them come from a position of wealth or power, absolving themselves from the front lines.

The only thing keeping protector’s guilds from turning into military bunkers is a strong democratic lean towards protectionist policies. However, that doesn't keep them from acting on their beliefs through questionably legal means.

## 🚫 Singularity

> _It's only a matter of time before those monsters devour everything we hold dear._

Singularity is the belief that the outlands and outlandian life do not belong in Eisenwald at all. They believe that resources spent building walls, constructing safety infrastructure, and hiring protectors should be spent destroying the outlands and eradicating all that lives within. For some, even if Eisenkind lives are lost in the process.

Most Singularists are actually more fearful of the outlands than those in other factions. They believe their mere _existence_ is too much of a threat to eisenkind life.

Some Singularists act with a stable, respectable, and realistic set of morals. But the active minority are caught starting forest fires, poisoning lakes, or even making use of chemical weapons. While succeeding in destroying the outlands, they knowingly disregard Eisenkind life caught in the crossfire.

Given eisenkind's knowledge of the outlands and its treacherousness, many actually don't strongly disagree with the ideals of Singularism. However, the aforementioned incidents have irreparably damaged that perception, causing many Singularists to hide their affiliation.

## ☮️ Cohabitation

> _They deserve to be here as much as we do. Maybe if we stopped shooting them on sight, we'd come to an understanding._

The Cohabitation faction believes that outland life is sacred and just as valuable as that of Eisenkind. Some even believe in a world where civilization can cross with the outlands, where all inhabitants of Eisenwald can live in peace and harmony.

Many Cohabitationists further much of eisenkind’s knowledge about the outlands, feeling more compelled to research and experiment than others who view the outlands through a more negative or fearful lens. Many are knowledgeable, talented explorers and biologists who believe Protectionists are holding society back.

However, there are the few who act less wisely. Those who open paths for dangerous outland creatures to encroach society, many occurrences of which did not end well. The emotional impact of these cases damaged the public perception of Cohabitation as a whole.

## 🪷 Naturalism

> _How would you feel if some self-righteous arrogant bandits took away your home and forced you to leave? Eisenkind are no better._

Naturalists believe that the land rightfully belongs to the outlandian creatures, and that Eisenkind have wrongfully stolen it from them and upset the balance of nature.

Their actions include destroying the infrastructure that protects Eisenkind from the outlands, seeking and stopping protectors, and inciting the wrath of outlandians through various means. Naturalists have long debated and fought over whether these methods are productive.

Members of this faction tend to act out of the eyes of society and, more importantly, the law. They're often found in the Undergrowth and the various unwatched spaces betwixt societies, but some are perfectly comfortable walking among crowds and hiding in plain sight.

# Currency

Eisenwald's common currency is the Rosenfeld Note, often in the form of paper bills made from paper-like cloth and imprinted with counterfeit protection.

Much of Eisenwald’s economy used to run simply via bartering, but as populations grew larger and people specialized, the need for currency became inevitable.

Various eisenkind from all over came up with their own solutions and proposals, but ultimately, the Rosenfeld Note won over all others, and all of Eisenwald adopted it as the standard currency.

Azeurian Silver held prominence for a good amount of time, and it still circulates within Azeurus, but the note is still accepted. Historians aren't certain why silver lived, but attribute it to Azeurus’ history of pride and stubbornness.

# Calendar

![A chart of Eisenwald's seasons](/guide/seasons.png)
Throughout the history of Eisenwald, different regions used their own calendar systems, but as the world became more connected, communication and trade grew more difficult over time.

The Rosenfeld Standard Calendar won over a handful of other proposed calendar systems, having started its “day one” just a few decades ago.

A month is 24 days, divided into four 6-day weeks, and the year is four months, for a 96-day year.

The names of months are:

1. Sunburst (Summer)
2. Harvest (Fall)
3. Snowfall (Winter)
4. Blossom (Spring)

The format of dates is roughly “\[Day] of \[Month], Year \[Year]”. Short format is \[Year]/\[Month]/\[Day]. Example: 12th of Blossom, Year 21 • 21/4/12

The first half of the year is the warm season, the latter half is the cool season. The highest and lowest temperatures of the year come in the middle of the seasons, where it’s much more mild and temperate at the transitions.

# Astronomy

![A chart of Eisenwald's moon phases](/guide/moons.png)
Aurora and Nocturne are the sister moons that call Eisenwald home. Nocturne is a larger moon with a slower orbit. Aurora has a much faster cycle, so much so it can be seen slowly moving across the sky with the naked eye.

The weeks and months are aligned with the cycles of Aurora and Nocturne. Aurora is visible for the first three days of each week, and Nocturne is visible for the first three weeks of the month.

The world is much darker at night while Aurora and Nocturne are both set. This increases the likelihood of certain creatures being out and about.

# Education

Academies in Eisenwald are very fluid, freeform, and practical, resembling colleges or trade schools in real life.

Eisenkind may start attending at any age and for any duration of time, depending on the subject matter.

Most students attend aspect art classes, focused on anywhere from the overall basics to specific aspects and capabilities. Protectors’ classes are also a popular pick.

Other subjects are more practical, such as woodworking, smithing, archery, agriculture, tailoring, and so on. More mentally focused classes like mathematics, economies, and business management are also available.

# Technology

When you can heat objects at will, you don't need a stove. When you can materialize ice, you don't need a freezer. When you can summon light, you don't need a flashlight.

The rise of aspect art absolved the need for various technologies that exist in the real world, especially when many cooperate and specialize in one or a few aspects to fill the gaps. As a result, much of Eisenwald's technology looks and feels reminiscent of the era before the industrial revolution.
