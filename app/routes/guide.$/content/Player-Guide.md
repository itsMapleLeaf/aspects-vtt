# Player Guide

Welcome to **Aspects of Nature**. Choose from many [augmented human races](Player-Guide/Races-of-Eisenkind.md) and harness the [power of nature](Player-Guide/Aspects.md) to further your destiny.

Maybe you’ll choose to defend against the dangers of [the outlands](Player-Guide/The-Outlands.md). Maybe you believe outland creatures and Eisenkind can live in harmony. Or maybe you want to give [Eisenwald](Player-Guide/Eisenwald.md) back to the outland creatures, its rightful owner.

Regardless of the [path](Player-Guide/Factions.md) you take, stay aware and vigilant. In this landscape of persistent conflict and divisiveness, even your most trusted allies could be plotting against you.
