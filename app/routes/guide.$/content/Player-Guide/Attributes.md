# Attributes

Attributes represent your characters’ aptitude for a given skillset, and each one is assigned [a unique die to roll](Dice.md) at creation. 

By default, **attribute rolls are always made with two dice**, and the effect is the total.

Certain abilities may refer to the *value* or *level* of an attribute.

The **value** of an attribute is the side count of its die. For example: if your intellect uses a d12, then the value of your intellect is 12.

The **level** of your attribute is its order in the [dice scale](Dice.md):

d4 → 1

d6 → 2

d8 → 3

d12 → 4

d20 → 5
