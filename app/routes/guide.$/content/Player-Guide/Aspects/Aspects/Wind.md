Although wind is known for being a whimsical, unreliable aspect, none deny its utility.

Those daring enough to try to work with this aspect make themselves useful in situations requiring swiftness, snappy reactions, and acrobatic mastery to run, climb, or leap past daunting obstacles.

Provided the wind plays nice with them.
