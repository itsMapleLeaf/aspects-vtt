# Experience

Experience represents the breadth of the party’s experiences in the campaign. The experience amount is shared by all player characters, and [can be spent to learn aspect skills](Aspects.md).

By default, players should start with 100 experience to spend on aspect skills, but you may use a different number (or none at all) to change the difficulty of the campaign’s starting experience.

Throughout the campaign, experience should be awarded by the GM on a per-session basis. As a guideline, you can aim for 5 experience for every significant event or challenge overcome in the session.
