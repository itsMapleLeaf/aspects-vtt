# Currency

Eisenwald's common currency is the Rosenfeld Note, often in the form of paper bills made from paper-like cloth and imprinted with counterfeit protection.

Much of Eisenwald’s economy used to run simply via bartering, but as populations grew larger and people specialized, the need for currency became inevitable.

Various eisenkind from all over came up with their own solutions and proposals, but ultimately, the Rosenfeld Note won over all others, and all of Eisenwald adopted it as the standard currency.

Azeurian Silver held prominence for a good amount of time, and it still circulates within Azeurus, but the note is still accepted. Historians aren't certain why silver lived, but attribute it to Azeurus’ history of pride and stubbornness.
