# Combat

Characters enter combat when two or more parties act adversarially towards one another.

To determine the turn order during a round, roll [Mobility](Attributes/Attributes/Mobility.md), going from highest to lowest, breaking ties if necessary. Different scenarios may call for a different attribute, such as [Intellect](Attributes/Attributes/Intellect.md) or [Wit](Attributes/Attributes/Wit.md) in more socially-focused situations.

On a character's turn, **that character is the first one to act**, unless an effect states otherwise.

Players start their turn with two **action points**. An action point lets you make a single action at any time during combat. A **reaction** is an action made out of turn.

An action will often mean using a skill, but other impactful acts may also use an action, e.g. planting a trap.

The GM may allow you to perform minor acts that don't use action points, such as welding a weapon or alerting allies of danger.

Combat ends when all adversarial acts end.

ℹ️ If you find yourself not able to move very far and there’s no other action you want to take, you might want to use the [Dash](General-Skills/General-Skills/Dash.md) action!

Likewise, consider using [Focus](General-Skills/General-Skills/Focus.md) or [Defend](General-Skills/General-Skills/Defend.md) if you can’t do anything else more impactful.

# Teams

In combat, every character can be a part of a team, or they can be unaffiliated. Characters within a team are all allies of one another. Other characters outside of their team are either considered neutral or enemies, depending on the scenario and other circumstances.
