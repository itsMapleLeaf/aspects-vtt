# Great Plains

Summary: Vast open fields of tall grass, spotted by lakes, groves, and patches of forest which eisenkind call home.
Conditions: Abundant Light, Very Dry, Windy

Towns in the plains tend to feel a lot more primitive and rustic than anywhere else, but dwellers and visitors have come to appreciate that. Settlements in the plains are simple, friendly, and relaxing.
