# Azeurus

Summary: Networks of towns built with marble and lime surrounding a populous capital city, nestled within its namesake gulf.
Conditions: Abundant Light, Abundant Water, Cold, Very Humid, Windy

The network of Azeurus is an inspiring feat of engineering and architecture, proudly the second largest collective settlement behind Rosenfeld.

Towns and cities of varying sizes are connected by piers of stone in various pastel-looking colors, most of it constructed with marble and lime, giving the city a shining feel of divinity only mirrored by Aeropolis.

Azeurus holds the largest population of cetacians and the largest number of water users. Those outside of either group unfortunately donâ€™t fit in very well. Outwardly, many Azeuran folk are friendly and well-meaning, but discrimination towards outsiders can still be seen on a broader scale.
