# Renari

Abilities: Sneak Attack - In combat, when targeting an enemy who hasnâ€™t taken their turn yet, roll with an extra attribute die.
Adaptable - Before the start of combat, you may swap two of your attribute dice until the end of combat.

Renari have fox-like features: large, pointed fluffy ears on the sides of their heads, a bushy tail of varying length, claws, and sharp teeth.

Renari are often mistaken for Felirians. The best way to tell them apart are by the size of their ears and the thickness of their tails.
