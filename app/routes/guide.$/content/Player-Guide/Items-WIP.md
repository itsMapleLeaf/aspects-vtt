# Items [WIP]

Items are usually purchased from shops, but you might find yourself lucky enough to find them elsewhere. Or maybe youâ€™re daring enough to try to take them without paying!

Every location has one or more marketplaces where you can buy and sell items. If you want to randomly determine found items or shop stock, an item random table can help here.

Every item is a generic representation of what you actually have in the world. For example, a [Rejuvenating Drink](Items-5BWIP5D/Items-Table/Rejuvenating-Drink.md) could be a pineapple mango smoothie infused with healing herbs.
