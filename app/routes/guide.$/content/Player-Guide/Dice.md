# Dice

The game system makes use of a scale of dice:

d4 → d6 → d8 → d12 → d20

Any one of these dice will be rolled depending on the potential range of impact for what’s being rolled. For example: physically strong characters would use a d20 for strength-based actions, and smart characters would use a d20 for actions requiring high intellect.

In this system, even with stronger dice, any action can still be fumbled with a low roll! What this means is up to the situation and the GM’s jurisdiction.

The result of the roll is the **effect**. This may be used for mechanic purposes (e.g. determining success or failure) or for narrative flavor.

A **competing roll** is when two rolls are made to decide an outcome, usually between two different characters.

## Modifier Dice

Modifier dice are d4 dice rolled alongside the main die which add or remove from the effect of a dice roll.

There are two kinds of modifier dice: **boost** and **snag**. Boost dice add to the effect, and snag dice subtract from it.

Modifier dice are the *only* way to strengthen or weaken a roll, and there’s no limit to the number of them a roll can have.

ℹ️ You might ask yourself: why use modifier dice instead of adding or subtracting from the roll?

Depending on how you’ve built your character, it’s easy to accumulate a lot of stress in this game. When that happens, a flat decrease on your rolls can make it difficult to do *anything*, especially with a weaker die, as many of your rolls would be reduced to 1.

Modifier dice give you a chance to succeed even when greatly impeded.

This system also allows you to accumulate stress and use it as an *advantage* in certain ways without being completely stunted by it. The [Light](Aspects/Aspects/Light.md) aspect is built around this.

Likewise, boost dice let a player accumulate power with no real ceiling while still keeping a small chance for failure. This adds suspense and even hilarity in moments where you *somehow* manage to defy the odds!
