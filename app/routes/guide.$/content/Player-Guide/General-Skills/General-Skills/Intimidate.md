# Intimidate

Choose a visible target within 5 meters. Roll [Wit](../../Attributes/Attributes/Wit.md).

The target must make an equal or higher [Sense](../../Attributes/Attributes/Sense.md) or [Wit](../../Attributes/Attributes/Wit.md) roll. If they fail, they take 1d4 fatigue and cannot approach or target you until the start of your next turn.
