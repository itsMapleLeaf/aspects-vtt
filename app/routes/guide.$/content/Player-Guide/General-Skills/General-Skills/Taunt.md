Target a visible character no more than 20 meters away. Roll [Wit](../../Attributes/Attributes/Wit.md). If the effect meets or exceeds the characterâ€™s [Wit](../../Attributes/Attributes/Wit.md) or [Intellect](../../Attributes/Attributes/Intellect-295b7ef15b5a463198445ac4b601d135.md-the-higher-of-the-two), their next targeted action must target you.
