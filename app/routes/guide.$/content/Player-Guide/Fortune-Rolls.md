# Fortune Rolls

Fortune rolls are d100 rolls made by the GM to resolve matters out of the playersâ€™ control: things that are entirely dependent on luck.

If you were walking across a rickety bridge over a river in the forest, the GM could make a fortune roll to determine whether or not that bridge collapses from under you. 50 or higher, the bridge stays in place.

The GM may change the threshold or interpret the result of the roll however they like, depending on the scenario. Many situations can be settled down to 50/50 coin flips, but more unlikely outcomes might require a higher threshold (70-90).
