Academies in Eisenwald are very fluid, freeform, and practical, resembling colleges or trade schools in real life.

Eisenkind may start attending at any age and for any duration of time, depending on the subject matter.

Most students attend aspect art classes, focused on anywhere from the overall basics to specific aspects and capabilities. Protectorsâ€™ classes are also a popular pick.

Other subjects are more practical, such as woodworking, smithing, archery, agriculture, tailoring, and so on. More mentally focused classes like mathematics, economies, and business management are also available.
