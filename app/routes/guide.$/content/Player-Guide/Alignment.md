# Alignment

A character’s alignment is a basic guideline that informs how they interact with the world and others around them.

|         | Evil         | Neutral         | Good         |
| ------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------ |
| Lawful  | Lawful Evil  | Lawful Neutral  | Lawful Good  |
| Neutral | Neutral Evil | Pure Neutral    | Neutral Good |
| Chaotic | Chaotic Evil | Chaotic Neutral | Chaotic Good |

## Morality

Good - acting to the benefit of others

Neutral - acting solely with yourself in mind

Evil - acting selfishly without regard of the well being of others, often to the detriment of them

## Order

Lawful - acting on a strict set of codes, whether that’s religious guidelines, laws, or ideals passed down through family

Neutral - making the most reasonable judgement given the situation

Chaotic - acting unpredictably, often without a clear motivation or direction
