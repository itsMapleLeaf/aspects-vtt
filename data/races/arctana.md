Arctana, sometimes called “Arctan” or casually “Arcs”, are bear-like species with small round fuzzy ears and equally small stubby tails, sometimes with claws or patches of fur.

# Trivia

- Arctana make up the majority of consumers in the seafood market.
- Arctana tend to feel sleepier and more lethargic during the winter than other races.
