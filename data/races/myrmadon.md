The Myrmadon race exhibits pangolin-like features: patches of thick scales that cover their body, a tail akin to that of [Pyra](Pyra%20b6f6d8dd544a49fb8facfbf8b19b3263.md), and/or tanned skin.

Myrmadon are one of the lesser seen races in Eisenwald. Many of them live in the Undergrowth, but they prefer to dig out their own isolated spaces separate from others.

A history of prejudice combined with their relatively long life spans left this race with lingering trust issues towards eisenkind of other races.
