# aspect skills

- goals:
  - create a satisfying sense of progression through gaining new powers and making them more powerful; "oh wow, it's cool I can do this now!"
  - tie into the narrative / RP somehow (having the most trouble with this - what if I did EXP updates at the start? or go with the "ingame training" thing)
  - not be too difficult or overwhelming - if i'm trying to beat D&D in this respect, not a very high bar LOL
  - kinda sorta make sense from a "how hard would it be to do this" standpoint going from easy to hard
- idea: each aspect can maybe provide some boost to its related attribute?
  - like, fire has a "volcanic strength" which adds a boost to every strength roll or something
  - or maybe you just gain more boosts as you fill tracks?
    - lmao lemme just roll my 2d12+12d6 fireball
- note: definitely add example descriptions of stuff you could do with each track item
- note: start with low prices
  - i often think things are more powerful and wanted than they end up being, and I can always increase the cost of things and refund or give them bonuses lol
- note: it's _probably_ fine for some aspects to have more content than others

## concept: tracks

- track: progression line in which you spend exp to unlock more general capabilities
  - wtf do i call track items
    - steps
    - abilities
    - capabilites
    - levels
- your combination of tracks informs what you can do
  - water user with "nearby" proximity and "condensation" could summon rainstorms (holy fuck)
- tracks are unordered; you can buy higher cost items without getting the lower ones
  - then they're more like sets than lines?
  - it probably still makes sense to have some prereqs
    - e.g. you would probably need visible prox to have nearby prox, as the latter is an extension of the former
- any 0-cost item is granted immediately
  - basically under the assumption that it's a core requirement to doing aspect art, period
    - like, if you don't have touch proximity, then what proximity is it? mental? lmao
  - although it's possible I shouldn't even list them
