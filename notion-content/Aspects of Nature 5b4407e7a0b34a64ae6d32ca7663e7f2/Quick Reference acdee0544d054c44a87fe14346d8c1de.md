# Aspects

Aspects are the elements to which eisenkind can manipulate to various ends, an act referred to as **aspect art**.

## Fire

Uses: dealing direct damage, breaking things, burning things

Drawbacks: self-inflicted damage

Basic ability: Make Flame - You can create fires that float over the palms of your hands. When doing so, take one damage for every soccer ball size of the flame beyond the first. Close your hand to extinguish the flame.

## Water

Uses: environmental augmentation, for purposes of protecting allies or impairing enemies

Drawbacks: effects are indiscriminate and require strategic positioning

Basic ability: Shape Water - You can move, reform, and/or propel a mass of water, taking one fatigue for each eisenkind-mass of the water beyond the first.

## Wind

Uses: heightening movement - reaching destinations more quickly, escaping danger, or getting to hard-to-reach places

Drawbacks: randomness üé≤

Basic ability: Command Wind - Create small gusts of wind in a nearby area. Move any nearby eisenkind-mass objects and characters 1d4 meters in a chosen direction.

## Light

Uses: healing and strengthening others

Drawbacks: taking lots of fatigue

Basic ability: Summon Light - Create an orb of light in your hand which illuminates an area of size equal to your intellect.

## Darkness

Uses: confusion, illusions, weakening others

Drawbacks: effects are often non-immediate and/or delayed

Basic ability: Corrupt - Take one fatigue to touch and set a curse of corruption on a nearby target. Cursed objects cease to emit light, and cursed characters have +1 snag die on their next roll.

# Aspect Skills

You can use aspect skills at any time.

If a skill is **passive**, like [Waterwalk](Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc/Waterwalk%20ee6c525f9dd447738dfd7ab413975c9d.md), it is persistently active and does not require an action roll.

A **pure skill** is an aspect skill with only one attribute.

[Aquatic Path](Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc/Aquatic%20Path%20d05de8039c7d4e389fde2987a5bf277d.md) and [Wind Slash](https://www.notion.so/Wind-Slash-126629d857a241ae9ea78729588bc174?pvs=21) are pure.

[Aimless Fury](Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc/Aimless%20Fury%204bc34e9e8dac401188f5fd8086f8f819.md) and [Rageful Deception](Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc/Rageful%20Deception%20213a0452dabb4f4bb1dbfe70df522391.md) are **not** pure.

## Secret Actions

For aspect skills that rely on a ‚Äúsecretly‚Äù performed action, write down your choice somewhere‚Äîon a note card, or behind a spoiler in a chat message‚Äîalong with any relevant values, like the effect of the roll.

- Once you make your choice, **you can‚Äôt change it**.
- Keep it hidden from **everyone**, including the GM!

When the secret is triggered, reveal your note and resolve relevant effects.

## Learning New Aspect Skills / Spending Experience

First two skills are free, but:

- They must be [pure](Quick%20Reference%20acdee0544d054c44a87fe14346d8c1de.md)
- They both must have the same aspect

### Skill Costs

Skill cost: 5 times the attribute count, + 5 for every skill after that.

[Quake](https://www.notion.so/Quake-77e59ca51e2f485695060e72bef006bc?pvs=21) has one aspect: costs 5 as your first, 10 as your second, 15 as your third.

[Burden Reflection](Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc/Burden%20Reflection%20fc51032fa0804acb858e095d2af243a8.md) has two aspects: costs 10 as your first, 15 as your second, 20 as your third.

As a formula, for nerds:

$5 * aspectCount + max(0, skillCount - 2) * 5$

# Item Availability

When in a shop, for any sought-after item, roll [Sense](Attributes%20293fb106d9a34cbb82aebb6fd6b19e6f/Sense%20fc9761b47cbb4ff2a86a406988484f2b.md) or [Intellect](Attributes%20293fb106d9a34cbb82aebb6fd6b19e6f/Intellect%205f17314e41084e67bb8603f60c0845b6.md) to determine if it‚Äôs in stock, requiring a result based on the rarity:

- Common: 3 or greater
- Uncommon: 8 or greater
- Rare: 12 or greater
- Very Rare: 18 or greater

# Dice Rolls

Every dice roll makes use of a die from the dice sequence:

d4 ‚Üí d6 ‚Üí d8 ‚Üí d12 ‚Üí d20

The result of your roll is the **effect**.

The ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of a die is its side count‚Äîif your intellect is a d8, then the value of your intellect and intellect die is 8.

If you roll the highest number on the die, the die **explodes**. Roll it again and add that to the effect. This can repeat.

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è If an ability says to apply a dice roll amount to multiple targets, instead of rolling per target, roll **once**, then apply the result.

</aside>

## Modifier Dice

d4 dice which modify the effect by their face value

- Boost: adds to the effect
- Snag: subtracts from the effect

Any roll can be modified.

Any roll can have any number of boost or snag dice.

Modifier dice **do not** explode.

# Actions

You can perform _any_ action (within reason), and DM chooses the best attribute for the action, and whether it requires a dice roll at all.

Dice rolls are required for anything your character wants to do that may or may not succeed.

[](General%20Skills%20c231c7d0b6f84367abb6e0f12372860e.md): a special kind of predetermined action that can be used by everyone

[](Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc.md): a special kind of skill which requires learning before using it

# Stress, Damage, & Fatigue

Damage represents physical stress, and fatigue represents mental stress.

Heal damage through [Aquatic Healing](General%20Skills%20c231c7d0b6f84367abb6e0f12372860e/Aquatic%20Healing%202c1b0c3b344c4bb7b8ee038ce5bc8f04.md), [Illuminated Healing](General%20Skills%20c231c7d0b6f84367abb6e0f12372860e/Illuminated%20Healing%208efbfe3fe7f04e8686163b68d2547a0b.md), or items.

Heal fatigue with items, or perform an in-game rest to heal 1d6 fatigue.

## Thresholds

Damage threshold depends on strength and fatigue threshold depends on sense, where:

- d20 ‚Üí 16
- d12 ‚Üí 14
- lower ‚Üí 12

## Critical Condition & Saves

If you take stress which brings you above your threshold, you enter **critical condition**.

**Critical save** roll: 1d100, where:

- Greater or equal to threshold ‚Üí critical injury
- Lower than threshold ‚Üí incapacitated, cannot move or take actions until below threshold

You make a critical save roll when:

- Entering critical condition
- In combat, at the start of your turn
- Out of combat, taking stress while in critical condition

Damage taken from a critical condition **does not** trigger a critical save roll.

### Damage Critical Injuries

1. Internal Bleeding - Any time you take damage, add 2d4 to it.
2. Broken Bone - Subtract 1d12 movement each turn to a minimum of 1.
3. Concussion - Double the modifier value of snag dice for Sense, Intellect, and Wit rolls.
4. Dislocation - Subtract 1d12 from the effect of your strength and mobility rolls.
5. Pulled Muscle - Immediately take 2d12 additional damage.
6. Overexerted - All of your action rolls use a 1d4.

### Fatigue Critical Injuries

1. Crippling Migraine - You must take 1d4 fatigue before making any action.
2. Panic Attack - Immediately take 2d12 fatigue.
3. Neural Stunlock - Double the modifier value of snag dice for intellect rolls.
4. Exhaustion - The effect of your wit and intellect rolls is 1.
5. Confusion - Your sense, intellect, and wit rolls use a 1d4.
6. Sensory Overload - The effect of your sense rolls is 1.

# Distance & Movement

- The game plays on a 2D square grid
- Each square is a square meter
- Distances are measured in **[Manhattan distance](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance)**, in other words, the horizontal distance plus the vertical distance. **I**f you move 2 meters left and 2 meters up, you are 4 meters from where you started.
- Area effects are squares, where the size is the width and height of the square. Unless stated otherwise, the square is centered on whoever or whatever the effect originated from.

# Combat

Combat is organized in **rounds**.

One round lasts for 5-10 seconds in-game.

During a round, each player declares what they want to do. Resolve all actions simultaneously, and break conflicts with appropriate contested rolls.

On your turn:

- You can make one action
- You can take 1 fatigue to make an additional action, once per turn
- You can move meters equal to your mobility

Examples of actions:

- Using [Strike](General%20Skills%20c231c7d0b6f84367abb6e0f12372860e/Strike%208d0e40750d1f4bc080a681fcf17047c3.md) to punch someone
- Perform first aid with [Aquatic Healing](General%20Skills%20c231c7d0b6f84367abb6e0f12372860e/Aquatic%20Healing%202c1b0c3b344c4bb7b8ee038ce5bc8f04.md)
- Using [Absolute Dark](Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc/Absolute%20Dark%20cd798b5be81a43329fdb1e7694992d71.md) to increase the tension üòà
- Deciphering an ancient book
- Disarming a trap so you don‚Äôt get crushed by the stone walls closing in on you :)

The GM may also let you do minor actions: something less impactful that doesn‚Äôt require a dice roll, and/or something you can offhandedly do alongside a normal action.

Examples of minor actions:

- Pulling out a weapon
- Taking off a heavy cloak
- Giving someone an item
- Alerting allies of danger or giving them other important information
