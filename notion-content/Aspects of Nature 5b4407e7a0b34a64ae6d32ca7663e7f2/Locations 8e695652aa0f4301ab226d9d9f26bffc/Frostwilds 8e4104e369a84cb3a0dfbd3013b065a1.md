# Frostwilds

Summary: A bitter cold vastness of evergreen forests and barren tundras.
Conditions: Abundant Water, Dim Light, Freezing Cold, Windy

The conditions of the Frostwilds are a great hurdle to many to those who travel through. Temperatures stay well below freezing throughout most of the year, and summers are brief. 

Like the Whisperwood, the Frostwilds houses its own unique and prized selection of wildlife. Expert Frostwilds navigators make a comfortable living harvesting resources here that canâ€™t be found elsewhere, as well as providing advice and aid for those unfamiliar to the region.
