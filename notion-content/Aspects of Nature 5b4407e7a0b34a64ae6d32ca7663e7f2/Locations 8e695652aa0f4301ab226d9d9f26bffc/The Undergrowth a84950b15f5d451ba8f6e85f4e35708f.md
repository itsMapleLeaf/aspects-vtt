# The Undergrowth

Summary: Expansive underground caverns dimly illuminated by a self-sustaining ecosystem of bioluminescent wildlife.
Conditions: Very Dark, Very Humid

Visitors of the undergrowth describe it as an entire world of its own. The tall, spacious caverns block off almost all of Eisenwald’s light, but they remain hospitable through the cave’s dense population of bioluminescent plant life: a self-sustaining ecosystem fueled by unexplained supernatural causes.

This natural phenomenon gives a home in the undergrowth to darkness users who don’t take kindly to Eisenwald’s light. The undergrowth also houses the largest population of umbraleth; some believe that the existence of umbraleth itself came about through the ill-understood aspect of darkness.

Given the environment and the nature of its dwellers, many secrets are kept and traded in the undergrowth. The region is infamous for its many morally and legally questionable happenings between its loosely-connected network of cavern-bound vertical settlements. But that doesn’t deter those with a strong enough curiosity to dig for secrets of their own.
