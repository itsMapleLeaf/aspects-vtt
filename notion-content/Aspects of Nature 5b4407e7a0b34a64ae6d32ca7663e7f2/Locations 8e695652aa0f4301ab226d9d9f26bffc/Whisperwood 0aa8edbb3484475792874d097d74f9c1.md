# Whisperwood

The Whisperwood is a dense temperate forest populated with a diverse variety of wildlife and greenery. An extensive history of tales and legends gives it its name, detailing mysterious occurrences and sightings in the forest.

A large river, aptly named the Whisperwood River, runs through the middle of forest. A handful of small towns settled alongside this river, many of which act as resting points for travelers.
