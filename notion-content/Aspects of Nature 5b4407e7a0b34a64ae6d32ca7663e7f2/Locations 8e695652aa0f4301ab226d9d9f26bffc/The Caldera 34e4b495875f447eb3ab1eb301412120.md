# The Caldera

Summary: A massive igneous crater: the remains of Eisenwald’s one and only dying volcano.
Conditions: Abundant Light, Very Dry, Very Hot, Windy

Although Eisenwald’s seismic activity is mostly nonexistent, the Caldera loudly and aggressively acts antithetical to this fact, being a monstrous crater that resulted from repeated eruptions during Eisenwald’s early history. Although the volcano’s activity died down over time, experts still classify the Caldera as an active volcano, with occasional earthquakes and spouts of lava escaping from cracks spotting the crater.

The Caldera is populated by a small majority of ‣, with great racial diversity otherwise, second to Rosenfeld. However, the stark, _stark_ majority of eisenkind here are fire-aligned. While the sweltering heat and constant risk of danger would drive many other eisenkind away, not only are most fire users undeterred, many of them feel strength and vitality in this environment.

The outer rim makes for a surprisingly hospitable area for farming, grazing, hunting, and trading, with greenery having grown its way up the slope of the rim. The inner crater is rich with precious minerals and other resources that sustain the economic well-being of those within.

Fights break out frequently. Many inhabitants value strength, and aim to prove their own when questioned.
