# Aeropolis

Summary: Uniquely architected stone settlements built atop floating islands, travelled to and from by aquilian-engineered air ferries.
Conditions: Abundant Light, Cold, Windy

While Azeurus is famed for its technical ingenuity on the part of eisenkind, the cities of Aeropolis are built atop the natural marvel of islands that float over the rest of the land, moving from region to region on a cycle.

With the aquiliansâ€™ stronger capability for flight, many found Aeropolis a comfortable place to call home, given their eased travel between the islands.

Although Aeropolis is still mostly aquilian and users of wind, in recent years, Aeropolis has attempted to make itself more accessible to the rest of eisenkind, conducting regular air ferry flights to, from, and between the islands.

To this day, the floating islands are not very well understood. Some believe they float through electromagnetism of some kind, others attribute supernatural causes.
