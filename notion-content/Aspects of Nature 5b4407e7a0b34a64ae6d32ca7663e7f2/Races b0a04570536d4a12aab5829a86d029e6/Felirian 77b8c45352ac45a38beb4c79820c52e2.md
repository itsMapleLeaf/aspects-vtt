# Felirian

Abilities: Right Side Up - If you would take damage from a fall, you land perfectly on your feet, with a 50% chance to prevent all damage.
Slippery - When an enemy becomes adjacent to you, you may roll mobility and move that many meters away from them, then take 1 fatigue.

Felirians are known for their fuzzy cat ears, sometimes on top of the head, and other times on the side, where a human’s ears would be. They’ll usually have long, slender tails that share the same color of their ears and hair, claws, fangs, and eyes which glow and emit dim light in the darkness.

# Trivia

- On average, Felirians are twice as likely as any other race to get distracted or lose focus at inconvenient times.
- Many Felirians have a natural aptitude for acrobatics.
- Felirians don't tend to group up like some other races. In fact, they have an instinctual tendency to act territorial in the presence of others of their kind.
