# Trivia

- The tail of an Umbraleth is dense with nerves and is incredibly sensitive. Reactions vary; some feel ticklish from the touch, some feel a sharp pain with applied pressure, while others may feel arousal.
- Despite the sensitive tail, touching it is considered a very intimate gesture, paramount to a romantic love confession. Among other things.
- Umbraleth are stereotyped as charming social butterflies with multiple friends and partners. While this isn't true of all of them, they still possess a natural effect which make others feel very relaxed and unguarded in their presence.
