> *Hey! Sorry for calling out of the blue. I kind of just‚Ä¶ felt like talking and hanging out again. It‚Äôs been really boring in Rosenfeld. The most exciting thing that ever happens is Allison and Winter getting in fights, things catching on fire, and Allison doing spooky Allison things.

They‚Äôre definitely into each other, right? ‚Ä¶Well, either way.

I‚Äôm also a little worried, maybe. I know you told me to wait a few weeks before checking in, but the Outlands haven‚Äôt really calmed down much. I‚Äôve heard a lot of horror stories about it. Just be careful out there, alright?

Oh, also, Aya just came back from Whisperwood! One‚Äôd think that a trip through there would wear the girl out, but it seemed like she just came back with even* more *energy! As if she wasn‚Äôt already hyper enough, even for a wind user‚Ä¶ Either way, she says hi. Loudly. With hugs, as usual.

It seems like Arthur‚Äôs doing really well, too. I think he‚Äôs had his third, maybe fourth book published now? I always felt a little envious of how smart and ambitious he was. Just a little; I‚Äôm glad for him. I wanna go up to Aeropolis sometime and have snacks and tea with him again. He‚Äôs so fun and comfy to talk to.

As for me‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt really done much. I‚Äôm still figuring things out. I don‚Äôt know. Maybe I‚Äôll go out, just wander around aimlessly, and have a big adventure of my own. I ought to go back home to Azeurus and see Mom and Dad, too‚Ä¶

Erm, anyways, I‚Äôm rambling. I hope you‚Äôre doing well. Call me back whenever. Also, it‚Äôs **Lirael**, in case you forgot my actual name. Not ‚ÄòRae‚Äô. It‚Äôs not cute, no matter how many times you try to make it stick. It‚Äôs not!*

‚ÑπÔ∏è This game system is a work in progress and rapidly changing! For now, consider the [Quick Reference](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Quick%20Reference%20acdee0544d054c44a87fe14346d8c1de.md) as the source of truth.

Welcome to **Aspects of Nature**. With this game system, I had the following in mind:

- Make a system with simpler rules and cognitive overhead than D&D and its likenesses, but still with depth and versatility.
- Lean more on narrative to let players prioritize what their character would do vs. what‚Äôs advantageous from a gameplay standpoint.
- Rely less on limits and caps like spell slots. Instead, give them freedom, but with drawbacks.
- Capture the feel of a fantasy world with sprinkles of modernity.
- Create a system of supernatural abilities atypical from the usual ‚Äúwizards and wands‚Äù approach to magic.
- Make a cool and fun dice rolling system.
- Try to simplify the math of things as much as possible.
- Feed my love for kemonomimi üíñ

# Character Creation

Get out your favorite text editor, or some pen and paper if you prefer! Then fill out the template below and add a reference image if you have one.

## Character Template

Name:

What should we call them?

Gender / Pronouns:

How do they identify?

Homeland:

See [](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Locations%208e695652aa0f4301ab226d9d9f26bffc.md). A character‚Äôs homeland can influence their upbringing in various ways. 

The majority species and aspect on a location can be different from your character‚Äôs. That can even make for a more interesting backstory!

Race:

See [](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Races%20b0a04570536d4a12aab5829a86d029e6.md). Determines your character‚Äôs visual features and gives you some unique abilities.

Experience:

Experience is used to improve your character, and you gain more over time. Keep track of used experience to ensure your character is valid as you progress.

Attributes:

See [](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Attributes%20293fb106d9a34cbb82aebb6fd6b19e6f.md). Every attribute has a die attached to it from the [dice scale](https://www.notion.so/7d4f30c45723459090d126da81143440?pvs=21), and higher dice values have a greater chance of success.

**Do not roll the dice for values.** The dice themselves *are* your attributes!

Give each attribute a unique die from the scale, from d4 to d20. Here‚Äôs an example:

Strength: d6

Sense: d4

Mobility: d8

Intellect: d12

Wit: d20

Damage:

Damage accumulates from physical hits you take over the course of the game. Damage weakens your strength and mobility rolls.

Your damage threshold is the amount of hits you can take before you go down.

If your strength is a d20, your threshold is 16.

If your strength is a d12, your threshold is 14.

Otherwise, your threshold is 12.

Fatigue:

Fatigue represents exhaustion and mental weakness. It weakens your sense, intellect, and wit rolls.

Your fatigue threshold is the amount of mental stressors you can take before you go down.

If your strength is a d20, your threshold is 16.

If your strength is a d12, your threshold is 14.

Otherwise, your threshold is 12.

Notes:

The Rosenfeld Note is this world‚Äôs currency. Every character starts with 100.

Skills:

Copy your basic aspect ability and your racial abilities here, then choose two [](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc.md), and copy their names and descriptions here.

**Your starting aspect skills must both only have one aspect, and they must be the same.** For example, if you pick Wind as a starting aspect, they both have to be wind skills, and you can‚Äôt pick a skill that has both Wind and Darkness.

Items:

See [](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Items%207ef87382f643449bbeeb2ee785ba4230.md). You may start with one non-consumable item.

Profile:

Any other details about the character, such as their personality, their history, additional appearance details, or whatever else you‚Äôd like others to know about them. Be as concise or as detailed as you like.

Not everything has to be written down! Sometimes it‚Äôs more fun to keep some things a secret. ü§´

# Dice

The game system makes use of a scale of dice:

d4 ‚Üí d6 ‚Üí d8 ‚Üí d12 ‚Üí d20

Any one of these dice will be rolled depending on the potential range of impact for what‚Äôs being rolled. For example: physically strong characters would use a d20 for strength-based actions, and smart characters would use a d20 for actions requiring high intellect.

In this system, even with stronger dice, any action can still be fumbled with a low roll! What this means is up to the situation and the GM‚Äôs jurisdiction.

If you roll the highest number on a die, that die **explodes**. Roll it again and add it to the total, repeating until the die no longer explodes.

The result of the roll is the **effect**. This may be used for mechanic purposes (e.g. determining success or failure) or for narrative flavor.

A **competing roll** is when two rolls are made to decide an outcome, usually between two different characters.

## Modifier Dice

Modifier dice are d4 dice rolled alongside the main die which add or remove from the effect of a dice roll.

There are two kinds of modifier dice: **boost** and **snag**. Boost dice add to the effect, and snag dice subtract from it.

Example: You make a d12 roll with 2 boost dice and 1 snag dice. The d12 yields 5. The boost dice yield 4 and 1. The snag dice yields 2. The effect is 8: 5 from the main d12 die, plus 4 and 1 from the boost dice, minus 2 from the snag.

Modifier dice are the *only* way to strengthen or weaken a roll, and there‚Äôs no limit to the number of them a roll can have.

Modifier dice **do not explode**.

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è You might ask yourself: why use modifier dice instead of adding or subtracting from the roll?

Depending on how you‚Äôve built your character, it‚Äôs easy to accumulate a lot of stress in this game. When that happens, a flat decrease on your rolls can make it difficult to do *anything*, especially with a weaker die, as many of your rolls would be reduced to 1.

Modifier dice give you a chance to succeed even when greatly impeded.

This system also allows you to accumulate stress and use it as an *advantage* in certain ways without being completely stunted by it. The [Light](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Aspects%2051560ac666db47f7a87735a87d8c0729/Light%205eb70c67d6c5471cba5f52fdfcc351e8.md) aspect is built around this.

Likewise, boost dice let a player accumulate power with no real ceiling while still keeping a small chance for failure. This adds suspense and even hilarity in moments where you *somehow* manage to defy the odds!

</aside>

# Attributes

Attributes represent your characters‚Äô aptitude for a given skillset, and each one is assigned a unique die to roll at creation. 

The **value** of an attribute is the side count of its die. For example: if your intellect uses a d12, then the value of your intellect is 12.

[Attributes](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Attributes%20293fb106d9a34cbb82aebb6fd6b19e6f.csv)

# Stress, Damage, and Fatigue

Stress represents the mental and physical pain your character experiences. Adversaries inflict stress on your character, and you may gain it through your own actions as well.

**Damage** represents physical stress, and adds snag dice to your [Strength](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Attributes%20293fb106d9a34cbb82aebb6fd6b19e6f/Strength%201d86af6ba59e40e7a34b75952ad3ee01.md) and [Mobility](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Attributes%20293fb106d9a34cbb82aebb6fd6b19e6f/Mobility%20ded77836aa9542e896d3bec166eed385.md) rolls.

**Fatigue** represents mental stress, and adds snag dice to your [Intellect](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Attributes%20293fb106d9a34cbb82aebb6fd6b19e6f/Intellect%205f17314e41084e67bb8603f60c0845b6.md), [Sense](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Attributes%20293fb106d9a34cbb82aebb6fd6b19e6f/Sense%20fc9761b47cbb4ff2a86a406988484f2b.md), and [Wit](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Attributes%20293fb106d9a34cbb82aebb6fd6b19e6f/Wit%202c519cc463d348f0beda731c7c33e85b.md) rolls.

## Thresholds

Every character has a limit to the amount of stress they can take standing.

**This is not a hard limit.** Your stress can (and probably will) go higher than your threshold.

The damage threshold depends on your strength die, and the fatigue threshold depends on your sense die:

- d20 ‚Üí 16
- d12 ‚Üí 14
- * ‚Üí 12

If a hit brings you past your threshold, you'll have to make a 1d100 **critical save** roll.

If the result matches or beats the threshold, you‚Äôll get a critical injury. If you already have a critical injury, nothing happens. The GM may assign an appropriate injury, or you can make a dice roll and pick the corresponding result.

If the result is lower than the threshold, you‚Äôll become incapacitated, and you cannot make any actions until you are healed back below the threshold.

### Damage Critical Injuries

1. Internal Bleeding - Any time you take damage, add 2d4 to it. 
2. Broken Bone - Subtract 1d12 movement each turn to a minimum of 1.
3. Concussion - Double the modifier value of snag dice for Sense, Intellect, and Wit rolls.
4. Dislocation - Subtract 1d12 from the effect of your strength and mobility rolls.
5. Pulled Muscle - Immediately take 2d12 additional damage.
6. Overexerted - All of your action rolls use a 1d4.

### Fatigue Critical Injuries

1. Crippling Migraine - You must take 1d4 fatigue before making any action.
2. Panic Attack - Immediately take 2d12 fatigue.
3. Neural Stunlock - Double the modifier value of snag dice for intellect rolls.
4. Exhaustion - The effect of your wit and intellect rolls is 1.
5. Confusion - Your sense, intellect, and wit rolls use a 1d4.
6. Sensory Overload - The effect of your sense rolls is 1.

# Actions

For any action your character makes with varying levels of success, you‚Äôll roll with whichever attribute fits the most.

However, some actions in the game can be made without a roll, e.g. if they‚Äôre mechanically unimpactful, or if there‚Äôs no failure or success case. For example:

- Waving to someone
- Tapping someone‚Äôs shoulder to get their attention
- Warning others of incoming danger
- Giving a friend a hug

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è Depending on the circumstances, the GM may ask for a roll with some of these examples anyways. Like if a person is distracted, or if your presence is subdued, you may need to make competing rolls to see if they notice you, or if they get startled.

</aside>

## General Skills

General skills can be used by **all characters**, and have predetermined requirements and outcomes for action rolls.

[General Skills](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/General%20Skills%20c231c7d0b6f84367abb6e0f12372860e.csv)

# Positioning & Distance

Characters are positioned on a 2D grid, where each grid space, or **area**, represents a square meter.

You are considered **nearby** to another character if you occupy the same area or the area adjacent to them.

You must be nearby a target to physically interact with it, e.g. using [Strike](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/General%20Skills%20c231c7d0b6f84367abb6e0f12372860e/Strike%208d0e40750d1f4bc080a681fcf17047c3.md) or other touch-based actions.

Distances are only considered in cardinal directions, never diagonally. For example, if you move two meters forward and two meters left, your distance from the starting point is 4 meters. This is also called the Manhattan distance.

Effects describing ‚Äúareas of a size‚Äù define a square with that width and height.

# Combat

Characters enter combat when two or more parties act adversarially towards one another.

Combat consists of multiple **rounds**, and each member of combat may only go once per round. There is no fixed turn order, but certain circumstances may allow some members to go before others. For example: those succeeding a contested [Sense](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Attributes%20293fb106d9a34cbb82aebb6fd6b19e6f/Sense%20fc9761b47cbb4ff2a86a406988484f2b.md) roll vs. an enemy‚Äôs [Mobility](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Attributes%20293fb106d9a34cbb82aebb6fd6b19e6f/Mobility%20ded77836aa9542e896d3bec166eed385.md) roll for staying hidden, or those succeeding[Wit](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Attributes%20293fb106d9a34cbb82aebb6fd6b19e6f/Wit%202c519cc463d348f0beda731c7c33e85b.md) vs. an enemy‚Äôs [Wit](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Attributes%20293fb106d9a34cbb82aebb6fd6b19e6f/Wit%202c519cc463d348f0beda731c7c33e85b.md) to glean an enemy‚Äôs intent.

On your turn, you can:

- Take one action
- Take one fatigue for a second action, once during your turn
- Move meters up to the value of your mobility die, at any time during your turn

An action will often mean using a skill, but other impactful acts may also use an action, e.g. planting a trap.

The GM may allow you to perform minor acts that don't use combat actions, such as welding a weapon or alerting allies of danger.

Combat ends when all adversarial acts end.

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è If you find yourself not able to move very far and there‚Äôs no other action you want to take, you might want to use the [Dash](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/General%20Skills%20c231c7d0b6f84367abb6e0f12372860e/Dash%20a4169a6408204955aa50320b2658d490.md) action!

Likewise, consider using [Focus](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/General%20Skills%20c231c7d0b6f84367abb6e0f12372860e/Focus%206f5d7fe483d6474bb602f13291b3170e.md) or [Defend](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/General%20Skills%20c231c7d0b6f84367abb6e0f12372860e/Defend%204a5739ec9a844e3f80fb844bdcc59b58.md) if you can‚Äôt do anything else more impactful.

</aside>

## Teams

In combat, every character can be a part of a team, or they can be unaffiliated. Characters within a team are all allies of one another. Other characters outside of their team are either considered neutral or enemies, depending on the scenario and other circumstances.

# Date & Time

Keeping track of the current date and time gives the world a feeling of autonomy and life. You can make important events happen on certain dates, requiring players to be mindful of where they spend their time.

Each ingame day is divided into three parts: Daytime, Evening, and Nighttime. Each encounter or scene ingame should occupy one of these times of day. For example: you could spend daytime going around town and collecting important information, spend the evening stocking up on supplies, then spend the night resting. 

For some scenes, it may make sense to run multiple of them within one part of the day. The GM may make exceptions as they see fit.

# Spending Experience

Make sure you record the amount of experience spent on your character sheet!

## Learning Aspect Skills

Learned aspect skills must be **linked**, meaning it shares an attribute with one of your existing skills.

The cost for learning is 10 experience. Multiply this by the number of aspects linked to the skill. Each learned skill costs 5 more than the last.

For example:

- [Healing Glow](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc/Healing%20Glow%20c929b90ff9cb4af48b5e36f36bf3c892.md) is only linked to Light, so it costs 10 as your first skill, 15 as your second, and 20 as your third.
- [Ghost Form](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc/Ghost%20Form%201ed53f4644874650afe4e930d0d1c06d.md) is linked to both Darkness and Wind, so it costs 20 as your first, 25 as your second, and 30 as your third.

# The World of Eisenwald

> *Once upon a time, there were two umbraleth sisters: Aurora and Nocturne. At their awakening, the only company they had were each other. Faced with the darkness and danger of the surrounding uninhabited wilderness, they needed to quell their fears and work to survive the unflinching dangers of the Outlands.*
> 
> 
> *One day, the two felt a spark, a vague feeling that would allow them to follow the path to entangle themselves with the very nature of reality itself.*
> 
> *It started with manipulating water, making use of it in various ways, from offense, to protection, to healing and comfort. More experimentation led to more advanced techniques, such as turning water to ice and frost and embedding one's senses into the surrounding moisture in the air.*
> 
> *The two girls experimented further, moving from aspect to aspect, eventually landing on the five that Eisenkind are familiar with today: Fire, Water, Wind, Light, and Darkness.*
> 
> *Aurora and Nocturne made use of their new skills to fend off the dangers of the Outlands. They travelled across Eisenwald, meeting other people and saving as many as they could, while passing their knowledge to them as well.*
> 
> *A civilization naturally came out of this gathering of Eisenkind, growing more and more, gradually becoming safer and more prosperous as Eisenkind gained more aptitude in technology and aspect art.*
> 
> *Roses were Aurora‚Äôs favorite flower. Out of love, Nocturne wanted to give their safe haven a name: Rosenfeld.*
> 
> *After the passing of the two sisters, Eisenkind collectively named the two formerly unnamed moons after them. The older sister, Nocturne, became the larger moon, and the younger sister, Aurora, became the smaller moon.*
> 
> *But maybe that‚Äôs just a fairy tale.*
> 

---

Aspects of Nature takes place in **Eisenwald**, a world populated by numerous varieties of human-like people called **Eisenkind**, each possessing features of one of many animals.

The world's landscape is split into diverse, distinct regions, each spotted with cities and towns formed as safe havens from the surrounding outlands. 

## Races of Eisenkind

![Untitled](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Untitled%201.png)

Eisenwald is populated by human-like people, or **eisenkind**, with features of animals, such as dogs, cats, foxes, and birds, as well as other fantasy races like dragons and demons. Eisenkind exist in harmony alongside their races‚Äô origin animals, as well as a breadth of other fanatical creatures and mixes thereof.

### Custom Races

With eisenkind being as diverse as they are, some existing races may not fit into one of the predetermined categories.

When creating a character, you‚Äôre free to invent your own race and its abilities, as long as it fits the human-like theme of the others and you have approval from the GM.

You may also pick a more specific race, but choose the abilities from the closest one available. For example: felirians are based off of house cats by default, but a felirian character could be based on a lion, tiger, cheetah, jaguar, or any other feline animal. Likewise, a lizard-like character would probably fall under [Pyra](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Races%20b0a04570536d4a12aab5829a86d029e6/Pyra%20b6f6d8dd544a49fb8facfbf8b19b3263.md).

## Civilization & Culture

![Untitled](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Untitled%202.png)

In terms of architecture, culture, food, and so on, cities in Eisenwald feel like a mix of familiar fantasy tropes and elements of modern society.

You‚Äôll enter a walkable city with stone buildings and cobblestone streets filled with people dressed in colorful, stylish, and sometimes showy outfits. Spacious residential housings intermix with restaurants, clothing stores, marketplaces, and other businesses, many of which are self-run and unique to the town you‚Äôre in.

## The Outlands

![astrayfish_fantasy_anime_art_wide-angle_view_of_an_adventurous__183e82b1-8b7f-44e0-b153-3dc4f8a848ec.webp](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/astrayfish_fantasy_anime_art_wide-angle_view_of_an_adventurous__183e82b1-8b7f-44e0-b153-3dc4f8a848ec.webp)

The Outlands refer to the uncharted areas outside civilization populated by varieties of ferocious, monstrous creatures.

Many were once taught from a young age to stay within the safe confines of their home. However, the more adventurous and brave few opt to risk their well-being and venture through anyways. Some do it for the bounty of valuable resources found in the land and wildlife, other do so for the glory.

Nowadays, advancements in technology, weaponry, medicine, navigation, and aspect art have made it easier for anyone who wishes to delve into the depths. Despite all that, mistakes can be, and often are, fatal.

## Factions

With the outlands shaping much of today's society, deciding where people can be and where they can go, various schools of thought came about. People discussed‚Äîat length, sometimes violently‚Äîthe relationship that Eisenkind should have with the outlands. The various threads of opinions eventually settled into larger, more generalized factions.

Factions are no more than core sets of ideals. Just like a political party or a religion, affiliating oneself with a faction only means saying you're a part of it. That being said, some factions build institutions and coalitions to further their beliefs.

### üõ°Ô∏è Protectionism

> *I don't know what's out there, and I don't care. I just want to live in peace.*
> 

As the faction with the most members, Protectionists view the outlands as a dangerous frontier which should not be crossed, and that Eisenkind should separate and protect themselves from it as much as much as possible.

Protectionists run most of Eisenwald's modern society, in Rosenfeld especially. Many members of this view the other factions as fringe, unrealistic, and even harmful.

### üëë Imperialism

> *You're not scared of a bunch of dumb animals, are you? Can't take much to tame them.*
> 

Imperialists see the outlands as a resource for taking. They view outlandian life as inferior to Eisenkind, and their ideal future is one where outlandian creatures take on all of society's statedly meaningless labor, letting Eisenkind live in peace, comfort, and wealth.

Imperialists push for cities to bolster their military and resources to conquer the outlands. As you can imagine, many of them come from a position of wealth or power, absolving themselves from the front lines.

The only thing keeping protector‚Äôs guilds from turning into military bunkers is a strong democratic lean towards protectionist policies. However, that doesn't keep them from acting on their beliefs through questionably legal means.

### üö´ Singularity

> *It's only a matter of time before those monsters devour everything we hold dear.*
> 

Singularity is the belief that the outlands and outlandian life do not belong in Eisenwald at all. They believe that resources spent building walls, constructing safety infrastructure, and hiring protectors should be spent destroying the outlands and eradicating all that lives within. For some, even if Eisenkind lives are lost in the process.

Most Singularists are actually more fearful of the outlands than those in other factions. They believe their mere *existence* is too much of a threat to eisenkind life.

Some Singularists act with a stable, respectable, and realistic set of morals. But the active minority are caught starting forest fires, poisoning lakes, or even making use of chemical weapons. While succeeding in destroying the outlands, they knowingly disregard Eisenkind life caught in the crossfire.

Given eisenkind's knowledge of the outlands and its treacherousness, many actually don't strongly disagree with the ideals of Singularism. However, the aforementioned incidents have irreparably damaged that perception, causing many Singularists to hide their affiliation.

### ‚òÆÔ∏è Cohabitation

> *They deserve to be here as much as we do. Maybe if we stopped shooting them on sight, we'd come to an understanding.*
> 

The Cohabitation faction believes that outland life is sacred and just as valuable as that of Eisenkind. Some even believe in a world where civilization can cross with the outlands, where all inhabitants of Eisenwald can live in peace and harmony.

Many Cohabitationists further much of eisenkind‚Äôs knowledge about the outlands, feeling more compelled to research and experiment than others who view the outlands through a more negative or fearful lens. Many are knowledgeable, talented explorers and biologists who believe Protectionists are holding society back. 

However, there are the few who act less wisely. Those who open paths for dangerous outland creatures to encroach society, many occurrences of which did not end well. The emotional impact of these cases damaged the public perception of Cohabitation as a whole.

### ü™∑ Naturalism

> *How would you feel if some self-righteous arrogant bandits took away your home and forced you to leave? Eisenkind are no better.*
> 

Naturalists believe that the land rightfully belongs to the outlandian creatures, and that Eisenkind have wrongfully stolen it from them and upset the balance of nature.

Their actions include destroying the infrastructure that protects Eisenkind from the outlands, seeking and stopping protectors, and inciting the wrath of outlandians through various means. Naturalists have long debated and fought over whether these methods are productive.

Members of this faction tend to act out of the eyes of society and, more importantly, the law. They're often found in the Undergrowth and the various unwatched spaces betwixt societies, but some are perfectly comfortable walking among crowds and hiding in plain sight.

## Aspects

Characters in this world each gain the ability to manipulate elements of nature, or **aspects**, to various ends. This act of manipulation is called **aspect art**.

One can consider each aspect a tool which works best for doing specific things in specific scenarios, each with their own set of drawbacks and considerations for making the best of them.

## Basic Aspect Abilities

Every aspect has a basic ability associated with it, a skill that Eisenkind often practice to learn the aspect. To use a basic aspect ability, your character must have learned an aspect skill associated with that aspect.

For example, if you started with [Water](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Aspects%2051560ac666db47f7a87735a87d8c0729/Water%2056e95afa52f74b4587f0041150209bd6.md) skills, then you learn [Geyser Trap](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc/Geyser%20Trap%20e294f5b236d341a192207a951cc0e739.md), you can now use **Corrupt**, the basic aspect ability of [Darkness](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Aspects%2051560ac666db47f7a87735a87d8c0729/Darkness%207b5f4eed8a384ffeb7d384acb5b8d14b.md).

## Aspect Skills

[Aspect Skills](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc.csv)

Aspect skills are specific predetermined applications of an aspect, and they must be learned before you can use them. Player characters start out with two learned aspect skills from one aspect of their choice.

### Secret Actions

For aspect skills that rely on a ‚Äúsecretly‚Äù performed action, write down your choice somewhere‚Äîon a note card, or behind a spoiler in a chat message‚Äîalong with any relevant values, like the effect of the roll.

- Once you make your choice, **you can‚Äôt change it**.
- Keep it hidden from **everyone**, including the GM!

When the secret is triggered, reveal your note and resolve relevant effects.

## Aspect Interaction

There are many potential ways for aspects to interact that aren‚Äôt predetermined. It would be silly to predict everything that could happen! Therefore, interactions between aspects should be handled on a ‚Äúwhatever makes sense‚Äù basis.

Examples:

- A fireball meeting a blast of water in the air should cancel out in a puff of steam.
- The [Wrathful Tempest](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc/Wrathful%20Tempest%208f444c55d5b74a398a51a8c398b9a4d3.md) skill would likely increase the humidity in the air to help the [Water](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Aspects%2051560ac666db47f7a87735a87d8c0729/Water%2056e95afa52f74b4587f0041150209bd6.md)  aspect, or even make the scene darker to help the [Darkness](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Aspects%2051560ac666db47f7a87735a87d8c0729/Darkness%207b5f4eed8a384ffeb7d384acb5b8d14b.md)  aspect and hurt the [Light](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Aspects%2051560ac666db47f7a87735a87d8c0729/Light%205eb70c67d6c5471cba5f52fdfcc351e8.md)  aspect
- Unless circumstances determine otherwise, fire needs oxygen to live. Using the [Asphyxiate](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc/Asphyxiate%2046e9f4a0d1fc48049f3e75a6ea7ba41b.md) skill would not allow fires to burn within it.
- Movement via [Wind Riding](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc/Wind%20Riding%20e13369d91af647e9ab43e6096e04ae08.md)  would circumvent frozen floors made with [Permafrost](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Aspect%20Skills%20c4a6066f61224b06a7db32b7da50dedc/Permafrost%204d2f7559d1d44e18a661f3a007f80772.md).

## Locations

Eisenwald is partitioned into various distinct regions with their own look, feel, and sights to see, from lush forests with diverse selections of plant species, to vast, snowy taigas, to networks of caverns hosting their own unique variety of plant life, to cities built on the waters of a coastal gulf, and so on.

[Locations](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Locations%208e695652aa0f4301ab226d9d9f26bffc.csv)

## Economy & Items

Eisenwald's common currency is the Rosenfeld Note. Every player character starts with 100 notes.

<aside>
üìú Much of Eisenwald‚Äôs economy used to run simply via bartering, but as populations grew larger and people specialized, the need for currency became inevitable.

Various eisenkind from all over came up with their own solutions and proposals, but ultimately, the Rosenfeld Note won over all others, and all of Eisenwald adopted it as the standard currency.

Azeurian Silver held prominence for a good amount of time, and it still circulates within Azeurus, but the note is still accepted. Historians aren't certain why silver lived, but attribute it to Azeurus‚Äô history of pride and stubbornness.

</aside>

Items are usually purchased from shops, but you might find yourself lucky enough to find them elsewhere. Or maybe you‚Äôre daring enough to try to take them without paying!

Every location has one or more marketplaces where you can buy and sell items. To determine which items are available, make a  [Sense](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Attributes%20293fb106d9a34cbb82aebb6fd6b19e6f/Sense%20fc9761b47cbb4ff2a86a406988484f2b.md) or [Intellect](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Attributes%20293fb106d9a34cbb82aebb6fd6b19e6f/Intellect%205f17314e41084e67bb8603f60c0845b6.md) to determine if it‚Äôs in stock. The required threshold depends on the rarity:

- Common: 3 or greater
- Uncommon: 8 or greater
- Rare: 12 or greater
- Very Rare: 18 or greater

If you are in a location not listed for the item, the item‚Äôs price is doubled due to scarcity.

The item‚Äôs availability will remain the same until a new day passes.

Every item is a generic representation of what you actually have in the world. For example, a [Rejuvenating Drink](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Items%207ef87382f643449bbeeb2ee785ba4230/Rejuvenating%20Drink%20506cc36d09014ff9b02a009fe92309d0.md) could be a pineapple mango smoothie infused with healing herbs.

[Items](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Items%207ef87382f643449bbeeb2ee785ba4230.csv)

## Calendar

Throughout the history of Eisenwald, different regions used their own calendar systems, but as the world became more connected, communication and trade grew more difficult over time.

The Rosenfeld Standard Calendar won over a handful of other proposed calendar systems, having started its ‚Äúday one‚Äù just a few decades ago.

A month is 24 days, divided into four 6-day weeks, and the year is four months, for a 96-day year.

The names of months are:

1. Sunburst (Summer)
2. Harvest (Fall)
3. Snowfall (Winter)
4. Blossom (Spring)

The format of dates is roughly ‚Äú[Day] of [Month], Year [Year]‚Äù. Short format is [Year]/[Month]/[Day]. Example: 12th of Blossom, Year 21 ‚Ä¢ 21/4/12

The first half of the year is the warm season, the latter half is the cool season. The highest and lowest temperatures of the year come in the middle of the seasons, where it‚Äôs much more mild and temperate at the transitions.

![Untitled](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Untitled%203.png)

## Astronomy

Aurora and Nocturne are the sister moons that call Eisenwald home. Nocturne is a larger moon with a slower orbit. Aurora has a much faster cycle, so much so it can be seen slowly moving across the sky with the naked eye. 

The weeks and months are aligned with the cycles of Aurora and Nocturne. Aurora is visible for the first three days of each week, and Nocturne is visible for the first three weeks of the month.

The world is much darker at night while Aurora and Nocturne are both set. This increases the likelihood of certain creatures being out and about.

![Untitled](Aspects%20of%20Nature%205b4407e7a0b34a64ae6d32ca7663e7f2/Untitled%204.png)

## Energy Crystals

In Eisenwald‚Äôs earlier history, many got by riding captured horses and boars, communicating across long distances through mail, starting fires for heating, and so on. Aspect art made these sorts of tasks easier than otherwise. Nonetheless, many of these chores took a wayside after one pivotal conflict in the Caldera just decades before present day.

Conflicts between factions grew heated‚Äîfiguratively and literally‚Äîand with destructive conflict wreaking havoc on the dark slate of the inner crater, a deposit of softly glowing minerals showed themselves through a particularly large fireblast impact.

After lots of experimentation, trial and error, and unfortunate mistakes later, eisenkind found a new source of power in these crystals. This discovery made waves throughout all of Eisenwald faster than anyone could react. Entire new products, industries, and infrastructure grew around this wonder mineral, commonly called power crystals, energy crystals, or autogems.

Fast forward to today, the crystals power transportation, communication, and a higher standard of living in places that would otherwise be uninhabitable. They became a highly sought-after mainstay in eisenkind society.
